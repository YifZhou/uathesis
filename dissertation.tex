% We'll use the uathesis document class (duh).  The uncommented line
% below will produce a Dissertation, the others would produce a Thesis
% or a Document.  There are other options available to you like turning
% on the copyright statement and replacing the year on the title page
% with a "generated on" stamp (handy for early drafts).  To find out
% what the available options are, take a look into the uathesis.cls
% file and look for the \DeclareOption commands near the top of that
% file.
% There are five copyright options.  Copyright, no copyright, and three
% different Creative Commons licences.  Use the one you want (If you go
% Creative Commons, I (DM) think the CC-BY-ND makes the most sense)  See
% uathesis.cls for the reason why the non-commercial licenses are not
% included.
