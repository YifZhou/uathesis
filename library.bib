abstract = {Atmospheric modeling of low-gravity (VL-G) young brown dwarfs remains challenging. The presence of very thick clouds is a possible source of this challenge, because of their extremely red near-infrared (NIR) spectra, but no cloud models provide a good fit to the data with a radius compatible with the evolutionary models for these objects. We show that cloudless atmospheres assuming a temperature gradient reduction caused by fingering convection provide a very good model to match the observed VL-G NIR spectra. The sequence of extremely red colors in the NIR for atmospheres with effective temperatures from {\~{}}2000 K down to {\~{}}1200 K is very well reproduced with predicted radii typical of young low-gravity objects. Future observations with NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide more constraints in the mid-infrared, helping to confirm or refute whether or not the NIR reddening is caused by fingering convection. We suggest that the presence or absence of clouds will be directly determined by the silicate absorption features that can be observed with MIRI. JWST will therefore be able to better characterize the atmosphere of these hot young brown dwarfs and their low-gravity exoplanet analogs.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the orbital motion of the four sub-stellar objects orbiting HR8799. Our study relies on the published astrometric history of this system augmented with an epoch obtained with the Project 1640 coronagraph + Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) installed at the Palomar Hale telescope. We first focus on the intricacies associated with astrometric estimation using the combination of an Extreme Adaptive Optics system (PALM-3000), a coronagraph and an IFS. We introduce two new algorithms. The first one retrieves the stellar focal plane position when the star is occulted by a coronagraphic stop. The second one yields precise astrometric and spectro-photometric estimates of faint point sources even when they are initially buried in the speckle noise. The second part of our paper is devoted to studying orbital motion in this system. In order to complement the orbital architectures discussed in the literature, we determine an ensemble of likely Keplerian orbits for HR8799bcde, using a Bayesian analysis with maximally vague priors regarding the overall configuration of the system. While the astrometric history is currently too scarce to formally rule out coplanarity, HR8799d appears to be misaligned with respect to the most likely planes of HR8799bce orbits. This misalignment is sufficient to question the strictly coplanar assumption made by various authors when identifying a Laplace resonance as a potential architecture. Finally, we establish a high likelihood that HR8799de have dynamical masses below 13 M{\_}Jup using a loose dynamical survival argument based on geometric close encounters. We illustrate how future dynamical analyses will further constrain dynamical masses in the entire system.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm designed to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of point and extended source detections in direct imaging data. The novel part of our method is that it finds the linear combination of the science images that best match counterpart images with signal removed from suspected source regions. The algorithm, based on the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) method, is called Matched LOCI or MLOCI. We show using data obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager (NICI) that the new algorithm can improve the SNR of point source detections by 30-400{\%} over past methods. We also find no increase in false detections rates. No prior knowledge of candidate companion locations is required to use MLOCI. While non-blind applications may yield linear combinations of science images which seem to increase the SNR of true sources by a factor {\textgreater} 2, they can also yield false detections at high rates. This is a potential pitfall when trying to confirm marginal detections or to re-detect point sources found in previous epochs. Our findings are relevant to any method where the coefficients of the linear combination are considered tunable, e.g. LOCI and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Thus we recommend that false detection rates be analyzed when using these techniques.},

The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument's open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO2 in Enceladus' ocean.},

abstract = {Context. The large-scale magnetic field of solar-type stars reconstructed from their spectropolarimetric observations provide important insight into their underlying dynamo processes. Aims. We aim to investigate the temporal variability of the large-scale surface magnetic field and chromospheric activity of a young solar analogue, the G0 dwarf HN Peg. Methods. The large-scale surface magnetic field topology is reconstructed using Zeeman Doppler imaging at six observational epochs covering seven years. We also investigated the chromospheric activity variations by measuring the flux in the line cores of the three chromospheric activity indicators: Ca II H{\&}K, H$\alpha$, and the Ca II IRT lines. Results. The magnetic topology of HN Peg shows a complex and variable geometry. While the radial field exhibits a stable positive polarity magnetic region at the poles at each observational epoch, the azimuthal field is strongly variable in strength, where a strong band of positive polarity magnetic field is present at equatorial latitudes. This field disappears during the middle of our timespan, reappearing again during the last two epochs of observations. The mean magnetic field derived from the magnetic maps also follow a similar trend to the toroidal field, with the field strength at a minimum in epoch 2009.54. Summing the line of sight magnetic field over the visible surface at each observation, HN Peg exhibits a weak longitudinal magnetic field (B l) ranging from −14 G to 13 G, with no significant long-term trend, although there is significant rotational variability within each epoch. Those chromospheric activity indicators exhibit more long-term variations over the time span of observations, where the minimal is observed in Epoch 2008.71.},

abstract = {We present evidence that the recently discovered, directly-imaged planet HD 131399 Ab is a background star with non-zero proper motion. From new JHK1L0 photometry and spectroscopy obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE, and Keck/NIRC2, and a reanalysis of the discovery data obtained with VLT/SPHERE, we derive colors, spectra, and astrometry for HD 131399 Ab. The broader wavelength coverage and higher data quality allow us to re-investigate its status. Its near-infrared spectral energy distribution excludes spectral types later than L0 and is consistent with a K or M dwarf, which are the most likely candidates for a background object in this direction at the apparent magnitude observed. If it were a physically associated object, the projected velocity of HD 131399 Ab would exceed escape velocity given the mass and distance to HD 131399 A. We show that HD 131399 Ab is also not following the expected track for a stationary background star at infinite distance. Solving for the proper motion and parallax required to explain the relative motion of HD 131399 Ab, we find a proper motion of 12.3mas yr−1.When compared to predicted background objects drawn from a galactic model, we find this proper motion to be high, but consistent with the top 4{\%} fastest-moving background stars. From our analysis we conclude that HD 131399 Ab is a background K or M dwarf.},

abstract = {Most current atmospheric chemistry models and haze and cloud formation models for solar system planets and extra-solar planets adopt a 1D chemical-diffusion approach to approximate the global-mean vertical tracer transport. The physical underpinning of the key parameter in this framework, eddy diffusivity, is usually obscure. Here we analytically and numerically investigate vertical tracer transport in a 3D stratified atmosphere and predict the effective 1D eddy diffusivity K{\_}eff, commonly called K{\_}zz in 1D models. We find that K{\_}eff strongly depends on the large-scale circulation strength, horizontal mixing due to eddies and waves and local tracer sources and sinks due to chemistry and microphysics. We also find that the global-mean vertical tracer mixing does not always behave diffusively. If the chemical and microphysical processes are non-uniformly distributed across the globe-for example, photochemistry or cloud formation on tidally locked planets-a significant non-diffusive component might lead to a negative K{\_}eff under the diffusive assumption in some situations. Even in the diffusive regime, the traditional assumption in the current 1D models that all chemical species are transported via the same eddy diffusivity generally breaks down. Different chemical species in a single atmosphere should in principle have different eddy diffusion profiles. We find that K{\_}eff increases with tracer chemical lifetime and circulation strength but decreases with horizontal eddy mixing efficiency. Numerical simulations of 2D and 3D tracer transport on fast-rotating zonal-symmetric planets and tidally locked exoplanets confirm our analytical K{\_}eff theory over a wide parameter space. Using species-dependent eddy diffusivity, we provide a new analytical theory of the dynamical quenching points for disequilibrium tracers on tidally locked planets from first principles.},

abstract = {Imaging a star's companion at multiple epochs over a short orbital arc provides only four of the six coordinates required for a unique orbital solution. Probability distributions of possible solutions are commonly generated by Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, but these are biased by priors and may not probe the full parameter space. We suggest alternative methods to characterise possible orbits, which compliment the MCMC technique. Firstly the allowed ranges of orbital elements are prior-independent, and we provide means to calculate these ranges without numerical analyses. Hence several interesting constraints (including whether a companion even can be bound, its minimum possible semi-major axis and its minimum eccentricity) may be quickly computed using our relations as soon as orbital motion is detected. We also suggest an alternative to posterior probability distributions as a means to present possible orbital elements, namely contour plots of elements as functions of line of sight coordinates. These plots are prior-independent, readily show degeneracies between elements and allow readers to extract orbital solutions themselves. This approach is particularly useful when there are other constraints on the geometry, for example if a companion's orbit is assumed to be aligned with a disc. As examples we apply our methods to several imaged sub-stellar companions including Fomalhaut b, and for the latter object we show how different origin hypotheses affect its possible orbital solutions. We also examine visual companions of A- and G-type main sequence stars in the Washington Double Star Catalogue, and show that {\$}\backslashgtrsim50{\$} per cent must be unbound.},

Two published catalogs find C/O {\textgreater} 0.8 in 25{\%}-30{\%} of systems, and C/O {\textgreater} 1.0 in ∼6{\%}-10{\%}. It has been suggested that in protoplanetary disks with C/O {\textgreater} 0.8 that the condensation pathways to refractory solids will differ from what occurred in our solar system, where C/O = 0.55. The carbon-rich disks are calculated to make carbon-dominated rocky planets, rather than oxygen-dominated ones. Here we suggest that the derived stellar C/O ratios are overestimated. One constraint on the frequency of high C/O is the relative paucity of carbon dwarf stars (10 −3-10 −5) found in large samples of low-mass stars. We suggest reasons for this overestimation, including a high C/O ratio for the solar atmosphere model used for differential abundance analysis, the treatment of a Ni blend that affects the O abundance, and limitations of one-dimensional LTE stellar atmosphere models. Furthermore, from the estimated errors on the measured stellar C/O ratios, we find that the significance of the high C/O tail is weakened, with a true measured fraction of C/O {\textgreater} 0.8 in 10{\%}-15{\%} of stars, and C/O {\textgreater} 1.0 in 1{\%}-5{\%}, although these are still likely overestimates. We suggest that infrared T-dwarf spectra could show how common high C/O is in the stellar neighborhood, as the chemistry and spectra of such objects would differ compared to those with solar-like abundances. While possible at C/O {\textgreater} 0.8, we expect that carbon-dominated rocky planets are rarer than others have suggested.},

abstract = {The search for life on planets outside our solar system will use spectroscopic identification of atmospheric biosignatures. The most robust remotely detectable potential biosignature is considered to be the detection of oxygen (O2) or ozone (O3) simultaneous to methane (CH4) at levels indicating fluxes from the planetary surface in excess of those that could be produced abiotically.Herewe use an altitude-dependent photochemical model with the enhanced lower boundary conditions necessary to carefully explore abioticO2 andO3 production on lifeless planets with a wide variety of volcanic gas fluxes and stellar energy distributions. On some of these worlds, we predict limited O2 and O3 buildup, caused by fast chemical production of these gases. This results in detectable abiotic O3 and CH4 features in the UV-visible, but no detectable abiotic O2 features. Thus, simultaneous detection of O3 and CH4 by a UV-visible mission is not a strong biosignature without proper contextual information. Discrimination between biological and abiotic sources of O2 and O3 is possible through analysis of the stellar and atmospheric context—particularly redox state and O atom inventory—of the planet in question. Specifically, understanding the spectral characteristics of the star and obtaining a broad wavelength range for planetary spectra should allow more robust identification of false positives for life. This highlights the importance of wide spectral coverage for future exoplanet characterization missions. Specifically, discrimination between true and false positives may require spectral observations that extend into infrared wavelengths and provide contextual information on the planet's atmospheric chemistry.

abstract = {Absorption lines from water, methane, and carbon monoxide are detected in the atmosphere of exoplanet HR 8799 b. A medium-resolution spectrum presented here shows well-resolved and easily identified spectral features from all three molecules across the K band. The majority of the lines are produced by CO and H 2 O, but several lines clearly belong to CH 4. Comparisons between these data and atmosphere models covering a range of temperatures and gravities yield log mole fractions of H 2 O between −3.09 and −3.91, CO between −3.30 and −3.72, and CH 4 between −5.06 and −5.85. More precise mole fractions are obtained for each temperature and gravity studied. A reanalysis of H-band data, previously obtained at a similar spectral resolution, results in a nearly identical water abundance as determined from the K-band spectrum. The methane abundance is shown to be sensitive to vertical mixing and indicates an eddy diffusion coefficient in the range of 10 6-10 8 cm 2 s −1 , comparable to mixing in the deep troposphere of Jupiter. The model comparisons also indicate a carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) between ∼0.58 and 0.7, encompassing previous estimates for a second planet in the same system, HR 8799 c. Super-stellar C/O could indicate planet formation by core-accretion;however, the range of possible C/O for these planets (and the star) is currently too large to comment strongly on planet formation. More precise values of the bulk properties (e.g., effective temperature and surface gravity) are needed for improved abundance estimates.},

We identified 157 planet candidates, including 2 objects that were not previously identified as Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluate the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals in the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we found an occurrence rate of 0.57 (+0.06/-0.05) Earth-size planets (1-1.5 Earth radii) and 0.51 (+0.07/-0.06) super-Earths (1.5-2 Earth radii) per M dwarf. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of 0.18 (+0.18/-0.07) Earth-size planets and 0.11 (+0.10/-0.05) super-Earths per M dwarf habitable zone. Accounting for the cooling effect of clouds by doubling the insolation limit at the inner edge of the habitable zone results in a higher occurrence rate of 0.27 (+0.16/-0.09) Earth-size planets and 0.25 (+0.11/- 0.07) super-Earths per M dwarf habitable zone.},

The repurposed Kepler mission K2 is providing the first sample of young transiting planets by observing populations of stars in nearby, young clusters and stellar associations. We report the detection and confirmation of two planets transiting K2-264, an M2.5 dwarf in the 650 Myr old Praesepe open cluster. Using our notch-filter search method on the K2 light curve, we identify planets with periods of 5.84 and 19.66 days. This is currently the second known multi-transit system in open clusters younger than 1 Gyr. The inner planet has a radius of-+ 2.27 0.16 0.20 {\AA} R and the outer planet has a radius of-+ 2.77 0.18 0.20 R ⊕. Both planets are likely mini-Neptunes. These planets are expected to produce radial velocity signals of 3.4 and 2.7 m s −1 , respectively, which is smaller than the expected stellar variability in the optical (;30 m s −1), making mass measurements unlikely in the optical but possible with future near-infrared spectrographs. We use an injection-recovery test to place robust limits on additional planets in the system and find that planets larger than 2 R ⊕ with periods of 1-20 days are unlikely.},

abstract = {Brown Dwarfs are the coolest class of stellar objects known to date. Our present perception is that Brown Dwarfs follow the principles of star formation, and that Brown Dwarfs share many characteristics with planets. Being the darkest and lowest mass stars known makes Brown Dwarfs also the coolest stars known. This has profound implication for their spectral fingerprints. Brown Dwarfs cover a range of effective temperatures which cause brown dwarfs atmospheres to be a sequence that gradually changes from a M-dwarf-like spectrum into a planet-like spectrum. This further implies that below an effective temperature of {\textless} 2800K, clouds form already in atmospheres of objects marking the boundary between M-Dwarfs and brown dwarfs. Recent developments have sparked the interest in plasma processes in such very cool atmospheres: sporadic and quiescent radio emission has been observed in combination with decaying Xray-activity indicators across the fully convective boundary.},

abstract = {We present results from a two-night R ∼ 4000 0.9–2.5µm spectroscopic monitoring campaign of Luhman 16AB (L7.5 + T0.5). We assess the variability amplitude as a function of pressure level in the atmosphere of Luhman 16B: the more variable of the two components. The amplitude decreases monotonically with decreasing pressure, indicating that the source of variability—most likely patchy clouds—lies in the lower atmosphere. An unexpected result is that the strength of the K I absorption is higher in the faint state of Luhman 16B and lower in the bright state. We conclude that either the abundance of K I increases when the clouds roll in, potentially because of additional K I in the cloud itself, or that the temperature-pressure profile changes. We reproduce the change in K I absorption strengths with combinations of spectral templates to represent the bright and the faint variability states. These are dominated by a warmer L8 or L9 component, with a smaller contribution from a cooler T1 or T2 component. The success of this approach argues that the mechanism responsible for brown dwarf variability is also behind the diverse spectral morphology across the L-to-T transition. We further suggest that the L9–T1 part of the sequence represents a narrow but random ordering of effective temperatures and cloud fractions, obscured by the monotonic progression in methane absorption strength.},

abstract = {We have computed evolutionary models for extrasolar planets that range in mass from 0.1MJ to 3.0MJ and that range in equilibrium temperature from 113 to 2000 K. We present four sequences of models, designed to show the structural effects of a solid (20 M⊕) core and of internal heating due to the conversion of kinetic to thermal energy at pressures of tens of bars. The model radii at ages of 4-5 Gyr are intended for future comparisons with radii derived from observations of transiting extrasolar planets. To provide such comparisons, we expect that of order 10 transiting planets with orbital periods less than 200 days can be detected around bright (V {\textless} 10-11) main-sequence stars, for which accurate well-sampled radial velocity (RV) measurements can also be readily accumulated. Through these observations, structural properties of the planets will be derivable, particularly for low-mass, high-temperature planets. Implications regarding the transiting companion to OGLE-TR-56 recently announced by Konacki et al. are discussed. With regard to the transiting planet HD 209458b, we find, in accordance with other recent calculations, that models without internal heating predict a radius that is {\~{}}0.3RJ smaller than the observed radius. Two resolutions have been proposed for this discrepancy. Guillot {\&} Showman hypothesize that deposition of kinetic wind energy at pressures of tens of bars is responsible for heating the planet and maintaining its large size. Our models confirm that dissipation of the type proposed by Guillot {\&} Showman can indeed produce a large radius for HD 209458b. Bodenheimer, Lin, {\&} Mardling suggest that HD 209458b owes its large size to dissipation of energy arising from ongoing tidal circularization of the planetary orbit. This mechanism requires the presence of an additional planetary companion to continuously force the eccentricity. We show that residual scatter in the current RV data set for HD 209458b is consistent with the presence of an as-of-yet undetected second companion and that further RV monitoring of HD 209458 is indicated. Tidal circularization theory also can provide constraints on planetary radii. Extrasolar giant planets with periods of order 7 days should be actively circularizing. We find that the observed eccentricities of e {\~{}} 0.14 for both HD 217107b (P = 6.276 days; M sin i = 1.80MJ) and HD 68988b (P = 7.125 days, M sin i = 1.29MJ) likely indicate either relatively small planetary radii for these objects (R {\~{}} 1.1RJ) or tidal quality factors in the neighborhood of QP {\~{}} 107. For these two planets, it will be difficult to differentiate the contribution from tidal and kinetic heating. But the radius of HD 168746b (P = 6.403 days, M sin i = 0.23MJ) is sensitive to whether the planet's interior is heated by tidal dissipation or kinetic heating. The tidal circularization timescale of this planet is shorter than the age of its host star, but we show that within the observational uncertainties, the published RV data can also be fitted with a circular orbit for this planet. As more RV planets with periods of order 1 week are discovered, QP(Teq,MP) and RP(Teq,MP) will become better determined.},

The observed planetary configuration has been shown to be unstable on a timescale much shorter than the estimated age of the system ({\~{}} 30 Myr) unless the planets are locked into mean motion resonances. This condition is characterised by small-amplitude libration of one or more resonant angles that stabilise the system by preventing close encounters. We simulate planetary systems similar to the HR 8799 planetary system, exploring the parameter space in separation between the orbits, planetary masses and distance from the Sun to the star. We find systems that look like HR 8799 and remain stable for longer than the estimated age of HR 8799. None of our systems are forced into resonances. We find, with nominal masses and in a narrow range of orbit separations, that 5 of 100 systems match the observations and lifetime. Considering a broad range of orbit separations, we find 12 of 900 similar systems. The systems survive significantly longer because of their slightly increased initial orbit separations compared to assuming circular orbits from the observed positions. A small increase in separation leads to a significant increase in survival time. The low eccentricity the orbits develop from gravitational interaction is enough for the planets to match the observations. With lower masses, but still comfortably within the estimated planet mass uncertainty, we find 18 of 100 matching and long-lived systems in a narrow orbital separation range. In the broad separation range, we find 82 of 900 matching systems. Our results imply that the planets in the HR 8799 system do not have to be in strong mean motion resonances.},

We validated HAT-P-67b via two Doppler tomographic detections of the planetary transit, which eliminated potential eclipsing binary blend scenarios. The Doppler tomographic observations also confirmed that HAT-P-67b has an orbit that is aligned to within 12 degrees, in projection, with the spin of its host star. HAT-P-67b receives strong UV irradiation, and is amongst the one of the lowest density planets known, making it a good candidate for future UV transit observations to search for an extended hydrogen exosphere.},

abstract = {We have spectroscopically confirmed a brown dwarf mass companion to the hydrogen atmo-sphere white dwarf NLTT 5306. The white dwarf's atmospheric parameters were measured using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and X-shooter spectroscopy as T eff = 7756 ± 35 K and log(g) = 7.68 ± 0.08, giving a mass for the primary of M WD = 0.44 ± 0.04 M at a distance of 71 ± 4 pc with a cooling age of 710 ± 50 Myr. The existence of the brown dwarf secondary was confirmed through the near-infrared arm of the X-shooter data and a spectral type of dL4–dL7 was estimated using standard spectral indices. Combined radial velocity measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, X-shooter and the Hobby–Eberly Telescope's High Resolution Spectrograph of the white dwarf give a minimum mass of 56 ± 3 M Jup for the secondary, confirming the substellar nature. The period of the binary was measured as 101.88 ± 0.02 min using both the radial velocity data and i -band variability detected with the Isaac Newton},

abstract = {The admitted, conventional scenario to explain the complex spectral evolution of brown dwarfs (BD) since their first detections twenty years ago, has always been the key role played by micron-size condensates, called "dust" or "clouds", in their atmosphere. This scenario, however, faces major problems, in particular the J-band brightening and the resurgence of FeH absorption at the L to T transition, and a physical first-principle understanding of this transition is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new, completely different explanation for BD and extrasolar giant planet (EGP) spectral evolution, without the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the CO/CH4 and N2/NH3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and EGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature to the fingering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and at the Earth core/mantle boundary. The induced small-scale turbulent energy transport reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, explaining the observed increase in near infrared J-H and J-K colors of L dwarfs and hot EGPs, while a warming up of the deep atmosphere along the L to T transition, as the CO/CH4 instability vanishes, naturally solves the two aforementioned puzzles, and provides a physical explanation of the L to T transition. This new picture leads to a drastic revision of our understanding of BD and EGP atmospheres and their evolution.},

abstract = {Barnard's star is a red dwarf, and has the largest proper motion (apparent motion across the sky) of all known stars. At a distance of 1.8 parsecs 1 , it is the closest single star to the Sun; only the three stars in the $\alpha$ Centauri system are closer. Barnard's star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known 2,3 and has an estimated age older than the Solar System. Its properties make it a prime target for planetary searches; various techniques with different sensitivity limits have been used previously, including radial-velocity imaging 4-6 , astrometry 7,8 and direct imaging 9 , but all ultimately led to negative or null results. Here we combine numerous measurements from high-precision radial-velocity instruments, revealing the presence of a low-amplitude periodic signal with a period of 233 days. Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as an analysis of instrumental systematic effects, suggest that this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate planet around Barnard's star is a cold super-Earth, with a minimum mass of 3.2 times that of Earth, orbiting near its snow line (the minimum distance from the star at which volatile compounds could condense). The combination of all radial-velocity datasets spanning 20 years of measurements additionally reveals a long-term modulation that could arise from a stellar magnetic-activity cycle or from a more distant planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the candidate planet has a maximum angular separation of 220 milliarcseconds from Barnard's star, making it an excellent target for direct imaging and astrometric observations in the future.},

abstract = {We describe the discovery of a satellite in orbit about the dwarf planet (136472) Makemake. This satellite, provisionally designated S/2015 (136472) 1, was detected in imaging data collected with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 on UTC April 27, 2015 at 7.80{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.04 magnitudes fainter than Makemake. It likely evaded detection in previous satellite searches due to a nearly edge-on orbital configuration, placing it deep within the glare of Makemake during a substantial fraction of its orbital period. This configuration would place Makemake and its satellite near a mutual event season. Insufficient orbital motion was detected to make a detailed characterization of its orbital properties, prohibiting a measurement of the system mass with the discovery data alone. Preliminary analysis indicates that if the orbit is circular, its orbital period must be longer than 12.4 days, and must have a semi-major axis {\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}21,000 km. We find that the properties of Makemake's moon suggest that the majority of the dark material detected in the system by thermal observations may not reside on the surface of Makemake, but may instead be attributable to S/2015 (136472) 1 having a uniform dark surface. This "dark moon hypothesis" can be directly tested with future JWST observations. We discuss the implications of this discovery for the spin state, figure, and thermal properties of Makemake and the apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites.},

abstract = {We report observations of resolved C2H emission rings within the gas-rich protoplanetary disks of TW Hya and DM Tau using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In each case the emission ring is found to arise at the edge of the observable disk of mm-sized grains (pebbles) traced by (sub)mm-wave continuum emission. In addition, we detect a C3H2 emission ring with an identical spatial distribution to C2H in the TW Hya disk. This suggests that these are hydrocarbon rings (i.e. not limited to C2H). Using a detailed thermo-chemical model we show that reproducing the emission from C2H requires a strong UV field and C/O {\textgreater} 1 in the upper disk atmosphere and outer disk, beyond the edge of the pebble disk. This naturally arises in a disk where the ice-coated dust mass is spatially stratified due to the combined effects of coagulation, gravitational settling and drift. This stratification causes the disk surface and outer disk to have a greater permeability to UV photons. Furthermore the concentration of ices that transport key volatile carriers of oxygen and carbon in the midplane, along with photochemical erosion of CO, leads to an elemental C/O ratio that exceeds unity in the UV-dominated disk. Thus the motions of the grains, and not the gas, lead to a rich hydrocarbon chemistry in disk surface layers and in the outer disk midplane.},

abstract = {The NASA TESS mission will deliver hundreds of transiting exoplanet candidates orbiting bright stars. The spectrometers SOPHIE at OHP and SPIRou at CFHT will be ideal to obtain radial velocities of these candidates, confirm their nature, and derive the planets' masses. These measurements will be crucial to deliver the best targets for atmospheric characterization with JWST. Here, we calculate the required observing time with SOPHIE, SPIRou, and JWST for each of the TESS targets in order to prepare follow-up observations. To infer their potential for JWST, we restrict the calculations to the case of transmission spectroscopy with NIRISS. The radial velocity follow-up of the giant planets ({\$}R{\_}p {\textgreater} 4 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}) could be achieved with SOPHIE, with a median observing time of 3.47 hours per target, and a total observing time of 305 hours that includes the 80{\%} most favorable cases. Several small planets ({\$}R{\_}p {\textless} 4 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}) could also be confirmed, but most of them would require an unrealistic time investment. On the other hand, SPIRou is ideally suited to the follow-up of the small planets, with a median observing time of 2.65 hours per target, and a median observing time of 4.70 hours for the terrestrial planets in the habitable zone ({\$}R{\_}p {\textless} 2 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}, {\$}S {\textless} 2 \backslashrm \backslash, S{\_}E{\$}). With JWST, the 10{\%} most favorable small planets (184 planets) have a median observing time of 16.2 hours, and the 10{\%} most favorable habitable zone terrestrial planets (7 planets) have a median observing time of 59.7 hours. Overall, this study will help define a follow-up strategy and prepare observation programs with SOPHIE and SPIRou before the first planet candidates are delivered by TESS.},

Moderate-resolution (R ≈ 3800) 1.5–2.4 $\mu$m spectroscopy reveals a near-infrared spectral type of L4–L6 and an angular H-band shape, confirming its cool temperature and young age. The kinematics of 2MASS 0122–2439 AB are marginally consistent with members of the ∼120 Myr AB Dor young moving group based on the photometric distance to the primary (36 ± 4 pc) and our radial velocity measurement of 2MASS 0122–2439 A from Keck/HIRES. We adopt the AB Dor group age for the system, but the high energy emission, lack of Li i $\lambda$6707 absorption, and spectral shape of 2MASS 0122–2439 B suggest a range of ∼10–120 Myr is possible. The age and luminosity of 2MASS 0122–2439 B fall in a strip where " hot-start " evolutionary model mass tracks overlap as a result of deuterium burning. Several known substellar companions also fall in this region (2MASS J0103–5515 ABb, AB Pic b, $\kappa$ And b, G196-3 B, SDSS 2249+0044 B, LP 261-75 B, HD 203030 B, and HN Peg B), but their dual-valued mass predictions have largely been unrecognized. The implied mass of 2MASS 0122–2439 B is ≈12–13 M Jup or ≈22–27 M Jup if it is an AB Dor member, or possibly as low as 11 M Jup if the wider age range is adopted. Evolutionary models predict an effective temperature for 2MASS 0122–2439 B that corresponds to spectral types near the L/T transition (≈1300–1500 K) for field objects. However, we find a mid-L near-infrared spectral type, indicating that 2MASS 0122–2439 B represents another case of photospheric dust being retained to cooler temperatures at low surface gravities, as seen in the spectra of young (8–30 Myr) planetary companions. Altogether, the low mass, low temperature, and red colors of 2MASS 0122–2439 B make it a bridge between warm planets like $\beta$ Pic b and cool, very dusty ones like HR 8799 bcde.},

We use accurate LAMOST DR4 stellar parameters for main-sequence stars to study the distributions of short-period (1 d {\textless} P {\textless} 10 d) Kepler planets as a function of host star metallicity. The radius distribution of planets around metal-rich stars is more " puffed up " as compared to that around metal-poor hosts. In two period-radius regimes, planets preferentially reside around metal-rich stars, while there are scantily any planets around metal-poor stars. One is the well-known hot Jupiters, and the other is a new population of Neptune-size planets (2R ⊕ R p 6R ⊕), dubbed as " Hoptunes " . Also like hot Jupiters, Hoptunes occur more frequently in systems with single transiting planets than in multiple transiting planetary systems. About 1{\%} of solar-type stars host " Hoptunes " , and the frequencies of Hoptunes and hot Jupiters increase with consistent trends as a function of [Fe/H]. In the planet radius distribution, hot Jupiters and Hoptunes are separated by a " valley " at approximately Saturn size (in the range of 6R ⊕ R p 10R ⊕), and this " hot-Saturn valley " represents an approximately order-of-magnitude decrease in planet frequency compared to hot Jupiters and Hoptunes. The empirical " kinship " between Hoptunes and hot Jupiters suggests likely common processes (migration and/or formation) responsible for their existence.},

abstract = {As brown dwarfs and young giant planets cool down, they are known to experience various chemical transitions --- for example from CO rich L-dwarfs to methane rich T-dwarfs. Those chemical transitions are accompanied by spectral transitions whose sharpness cannot be explained by chemistry alone. In a series of articles, Tremblin et al. proposed that some of the yet unexplained features associated to these transitions could be explained by a reduction of the thermal gradient near the photosphere. To explain, in turn, this more isothermal profile, they invoke the presence of an instability analogous to fingering convection -- compositional convection -- triggered by the change in mean molecular weight of the gas due to the chemical transitions mentioned above. In this short note, we use existing arguments to demonstrate that any turbulent transport, if present, would in fact increase the thermal gradient. This misinterpretation comes from the fact that turbulence mixes/homogenizes entropy (potential temperature) instead of temperature. So, while increasing transport, turbulence in an initially stratified atmosphere actually carries energy downward, whether it is due to fingering or any other type of compositional convection. These processes therefore cannot explain the features observed along the aforementioned transitions by reducing the thermal gradient in the atmosphere of substellar objects. Understanding the microphysical and dynamical properties of clouds at these transitions thus probably remains our best way forward.},

abstract = {We present the radial velocity confirmation of the extrasolar planet Kepler-447b, initially detected as a candidate by the Kepler mission. In this work, we analyze its transit signal and the radial velocity data obtained with the Calar Alto Fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph (CAFE). By simultaneously modeling both datasets, we obtain the orbital and physical properties of the system. According to our results, Kepler-447b is a Jupiter-mass planet ({\$}M{\_}p=1.37{\^{}}{\{}+0.48{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.46{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}), with an estimated radius of {\$}R{\_}p=1.65{\^{}}{\{}+0.59{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.56{\}} R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$} (uncertainties provided in this work are {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} unless specified). This translates into a sub-Jupiter density. The planet revolves every {\$}\backslashsim7.8{\$} days around a G8V star with detected activity in the Kepler light curve. Kepler-447b transits its host with a large impact parameter ({\$}b=1.076{\^{}}{\{}+0.112{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.086{\}}{\$}), being one of the few planetary grazing transits confirmed so far and the first in the Kepler large crop of exoplanets. We estimate that only around 20{\%} of the projected planet disk occults the stellar disk. The relatively large uncertainties in the planet radius are due to the large impact parameter and short duration of the transit. Within the transit time interval, we find the presence of large (somehow modulated) outliers during the transit. We propose and analyze different scenarios that could explain these brighter data points, including instrumental effects, additional perturbing bodies, stellar pulsations, rotation of a non-spherical planet, and spot-crossing events. However, short-cadence photometric data (at the 1 minute level) is still needed to unveil the nature of this observational effect.},

abstract = {We present direct radii measurements of the well-known transiting exoplanet host stars HD 189733 and HD 209458 using the CHARA Array interferometer. We find the limb-darkened angular diameters to be theta{\_}LD = 0.3848 +/- 0.0055 and 0.2254 +/- 0.0072 milliarcsec for HD 189733 and HD 209458, respectively. HD 189733 and HD 209458 are currently the only two transiting exoplanet systems where detection of the respective planetary companion's orbital motion from high resolution spectroscopy has revealed absolute masses for both star and planet. We use our new measurements together with the orbital information from radial velocity and photometric time series data, Hipparcos distances, and newly measured bolometric fluxes to determine the stellar effective temperatures (T{\_}eff = 4875 +/- 43, 6093 +/- 103 K), stellar linear radii (R{\_}* = 0.805 +/- 0.016, 1.203 +/- 0.061 R{\_}sun), mean stellar densities (rho{\_}* = 1.62 +/- 0.11, 0.58 +/- 0.14 rho{\_}sun), planetary radii (R{\_}p = 1.216 +/- 0.024, 1.451 +/- 0.074 R{\_}Jup), and mean planetary densities (rho{\_}p = 0.605 +/- 0.029, 0.196 +/- 0.033 rho{\_}Jup) for HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b, respectively. The stellar parameters for HD 209458, a F9 dwarf, are consistent with indirect estimates derived from spectroscopic and evolutionary modeling. However, we find that models are unable to reproduce the observational results for the K2 dwarf, HD 189733. We show that, for stellar evolutionary models to match the observed stellar properties of HD 189733, adjustments lowering the solar-calibrated mixing length parameter from 1.83 to 1.34 need to be employed.},

abstract = {We have examined one of the key predictions of the magnetospheric infall model for classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), namely, the formation of a shock on the stellar surface. We find that accretion column emission can successfully reproduce the main observational properties of the excess continuum that veils the absorption features in CTTS. This success adds further support to the magnetospheric infall model for disk accretion. We have calculated the structure and the spectral energy distribution of the emergent continuum emission from a shock at the base of the magnetospheric accretion column. We find that the spectral shape of the excess can be understood as optically thick emission from the heated photosphere below the shock, appearing mostly on the Paschen and Brackett continua, and optically thin emission from the preshock and attenuated postshock regions, dominating at wavelengths shorter than the Balmer threshold. The accretion luminosity and rate depend on two parameters: the energy flux of the accretion flow, , and the surface coverage of the column, f, with typical values log {\~{}}10.5-11.5, of the order or up to a factor of 10 higher than the intrinsic stellar flux, and f {\~{}} 0.1{\%}-1{\%} of the surface area. The so-called continuum stars have accretion columns with similar energy fluxes than the less veiled, typical CTTS but with much larger surface emitting areas of f ≥ 10{\%}. At near-infrared wavelengths, the predicted veiling from the accretion column for typical CTTS parameters is nearly constant and ≤0.1. Only for the continuum stars are significant amounts of near-infrared veiling from the accretion column expected. For accretion columns with low values of , the Paschen continuum emission has spectral features, rendering the usual deveiling procedures uncertain. Magnetospheric flow Balmer emission may also contribute to the excess for stars with low- columns. Finally, accretion column emission can successfully reproduce the observed correlation between the excess luminosity at the U band and the accretion luminosity. This correlation does not depend on the characteristics (mass, spectral type) of the underlying star, at least in the range M3-K5.},

This gap splits the population of close-in (P{\textless}100 days) small planets into two size regimes: {\textless} R 1.5 P {\AA} R and =-R 2.0 3.0 P {\AA} R , with few planets in between. Planets in these two regimes have nearly the same intrinsic frequency based on occurrence measurements that account for planet detection efficiencies. The paucity of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 {\AA} R supports the emerging picture that close-in planets smaller than Neptune are composed of rocky cores measuring 1.5 {\AA} R or smaller with varying amounts of low-density gas that determine their total sizes.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of T dwarf companions to the nearby stars HN Peg (G0 V, 18.4 pc, {\$} 0:3 Gyr) and HD 3651 (K0 V, 11.1 pc, {\$} 7 Gyr). During an ongoing survey of 5 0 ; 5 0 fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with the Infrared Array Camera aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, we identified these companions as candidate T dwarfs based on their mid-infrared colors. Using near-infrared spectra obtained with SpeX at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, we confirm the presence of methane absorption that characterizes T dwarfs and measure spectral types of T2:5 AE 0:5 and T7:5 AE 0:5 for HN Peg B and HD 3651B, respectively. By comparing our Spitzer data to images from the Two Micron All Sky Survey obtained several years earlier, we find that the proper motions of HN Peg B and HD 3651B are consistent with those of the primaries, confirming their companionship. A comparison of their luminosities to the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of 0:021 AE 0:009 and 0:051 AE 0:014 M for HN Peg B and HD 3651B, respectively. In addition, the models imply an effective tem-perature for HN Peg B that is significantly lower than the values derived for other T dwarfs at similar spectral types, which is the same behavior reported by Metchev {\&} Hillenbrand for the young late L dwarf HD 203030B. Thus, the temperature of the L/T transition appears to depend on surface gravity. Meanwhile, HD 3651B is the first substellar companion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close-in planet from radial velocity surveys. The discovery of this companion supports the notion that the high eccentricities of close-in planets like that near HD 3651 may be the result of perturbations by low-mass companions at wide separations.},

@article{Farihi2017,
abstract = {Planetary systems commonly survive the evolution of single stars, as evidenced by terrestrial-like planetesimal debris observed orbiting and polluting the surfaces of white dwarfs 1,2. Here, we report the identification of a circumbinary dust disk surrounding a white dwarf with a substellar companion in a 2.27 h orbit. The system bears the dual hallmarks of atmospheric metal pollution and infrared excess 3,4 ; however, the standard (flat and opaque) disk configuration is dynamically precluded by the binary. Instead, the detected reservoir of debris must lie well beyond the Roche limit in an optically thin configuration, where erosion by stellar irradiation is relatively rapid. This finding shows that rocky planetesimal formation is robust around close binaries, even those with low mass ratios. The formation and evolution of planetary systems around close binary stars is a challenging problem, yet provides insight into the growth of planetesimals within evolving protoplanetary disks and planet formation in general. The small but increasing number of transiting circumbinary planets detected with Kepler 5,6 are providing the first tests of theoretical formation models. To date, it has been shown that in situ formation is unfavourable for most of these Neptune-to Jupiter-sized bodies due to the destructive, dynamical effects of the central binary on planetesimal agglomeration in the regions where the planets currently orbit 7-9. However, for a range of masses, including small planets, recent models predict favourable conditions for planetesimal growth within the snow line, thus promoting efficient terrestrial planet formation around binaries 10-12. Atmospheric pollution in white dwarf stars offers a unique and powerful window into the assembly and chemistry of terrestrial exoplanets. There are now more than three dozen planetary system remnants made evident on the basis of thermal and line emission from circumstellar disks 2 , and several hundred where photospheric metals indicate ongoing or recent accretion of planetary debris 13. The current paradigm of disrupted and accreted asteroids has been unequivocally confirmed by numerous studies, including the recent detection of complex and rapidly evolving photometric transits from debris fragments orbiting near the Roche limit of one star 14-16. To date, all polluted white dwarfs with detailed analyses indicate the sources are rocky planetesimals comparable in both mass and composition to large Solar System asteroids 1,17,18 , and thus objects that formed within a snow line. These findings demonstrate unam-biguously that large planetesimal formation in the terrestrial zone of stars is both robust and common. To date, over 90{\%} of such dusty and polluted white dwarf systems have been discovered among single stars, with a small fraction belonging to sufficiently wide binaries (orbital separation, a ≫ 100 au) where the evolution of each star-and any associated planetary system-proceeds as a singleton. The white dwarf SDSS J155720.77+ 091624.6 (hereafter, SDSS 1557) exhibits strong infra-red excess from ≈ 1,100 K dust, and has one of the highest known metal abundances 3,4 , but it has a distinctively low mass (M ≲ 0.45 M ☉ ; where M ☉ is the solar mass) that indicates a helium core. Such white dwarf masses are too low for single stars to attain within the age of the Galaxy, implying SDSS 1557 belongs to a class of remnants whose evolution was truncated prior to helium ignition 19,20. These low-mass, helium-core white dwarfs are often found to be short-period, spectroscopic binaries 21 , consistent with efficient (common) envelope ejection during the first ascent giant branch. SDSS 1557 was observed on multiple occasions with the GMOS and X-Shooter spectrographs at Gemini Observatory South and the Very Large Telescope respectively. The lower-resolution GMOS data hinted at radial velocity changes in the Mg ii 4,482 {\AA} absorption feature, and the higher-resolution X-shooter dataset revealed a robust period of 2.273 h with semi-amplitude K 1 = 40.4 km s −1 (Fig. 1). A close examination of the H$\alpha$ region reveals an emission feature arising from the irradiated companion, seen in anti-phase and with semi-amplitude of 267.6 km s −1. Assuming the emission is uniformly spread across the inner hemisphere of the companion, this implies a binary mass ratio (M 2 /M 1) of 0.14. Both the radial velocity data and the spectral energy distribution are consistent with a substellar companion of 0.063 M ☉ (66 M J ; where M J is the mass of Jupiter) seen at an orbital inclination near 63°. Table 1 lists all system parameters with uncertainties. Figure 2 shows the expected infrared emission from a mid-L type substellar companion at the white dwarf distance, based on the derived stellar parameters. Ultracool dwarfs earlier than L3 can be firmly ruled out, as the expected fluxes blueward of 2 $\mu$ m would be significantly brighter than those observed. At the same time, the substellar companion cannot account for the total excess emission in the system over the 2− 5 $\mu$ m region, as the 4.5 $\mu$ m flux is five to six times larger than expected for an L3 or L5 type dwarf 22. Even in the extreme case where the predicted 4.5 $\mu$ m flux from a mid-L type companion is nearly doubled-mimicking the peak-to-peak changes seen in related systems due to irradiation from the primary 23-the observed flux remains significantly higher. SDSS 1557 thus has both a strong infrared excess and atmospheric metal pollution at high abundance. It is therefore similar to more than three dozen known white dwarfs that are accreting planetary debris from circumstellar reservoirs that are consistent with tidally disrupted minor planets. The identification of orbiting dust and atmospheric pollution within a close binary presents a fundamental challenge to the disk modelling, as the canonical flat and opaque ring geometry},

abstract = {Low-mass planets are known to undergo Type I migration and this process must have played a key role during the evolution of planetary systems. Analytical formulae for the disc torque have been derived assuming that the planet evolves on a fixed circular orbit. However, recent work has shown that in isothermal discs, a migrating protoplanet may also experience dynamical corotation torques that scale with the planet drift rate. The aim of this study is to examine whether dynamical corotation torques can also affect the migration of low-mass planets in non-isothermal discs. We performed 2D radiative hydrodynamical simulations to examine the orbital evolution outcome of migrating protoplanets as a function of disc mass. We find that a protoplanet can enter a fast migration regime when it migrates in the direction set by the entropy-related horseshoe drag and when the Toomre stability parameter is less than a threshold value below which the horseshoe region contracts into a tadpole-like region. In that case, an underdense trapped region appears near the planet, with an entropy excess compared to the ambient disc. If the viscosity and thermal diffusivity are small enough so that the entropy excess is conserved during migration, the planet then experiences strong corotation torques arising from the material flowing across the planet orbit. During fast migration, we observe that a protoplanet can pass through the zero-torque line predicted by static torques. We also find that fast migration may help in disrupting the mean-motion resonances that are formed by convergent migration of embryos.},

abstract = {We discover that the very low-mass brown dwarf OTS 44 (M9.5, {\~{}}12 MJup) has significant accretion and a substantial disk, which demonstrates that the processes that accompany canonical star formation occur down to a central mass of a few Jupiter masses. We discover in VLT/SINFONI spectra that OTS 44 has strong, broad, and variable Pa $\beta$ emission that is evidence for active accretion at the planetary border. We also detect strong H$\alpha$ emission of OTS 44 in a literature spectrum and determine an H$\alpha$ EW of -141 {\AA}, which indicates active accretion. Both the Pa $\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission lines have broad profiles with wings extending to velocities of about ±200 km s-1. We determine the mass accretion rate of OTS 44 based on H$\alpha$ to 7.6 × 10-12 . This result shows that OTS 44 has a relatively high mass-accretion rate considering its small central mass. This mass rate is nevertheless consistent with the general decreasing trend found for stars of several solar masses down to brown dwarfs. Furthermore, we determine the properties of the disk surrounding OTS 44 through radiative transfer modeling of flux measurement from the optical to the far-IR (Herschel) by applying a Bayesian analysis. We find that OTS 44 has a highly flared disk ($\beta$ {\textgreater} 1.2) with a mass of 9.1 , i.e. {\~{}}0.1 or 30 MEarth. We show that the ratio of the disk-to-central-mass of about 10-2 found for objects between 0.03 and 14 is also valid for OTS 44 at a mass of {\~{}}0.01 .

abstract = {51 Eridani b is an exoplanet around a young (20 Myr) nearby (29.4 pc) F0-type star, recently discovered by direct imaging. Being only 0.5" away from its host star it is well suited for spectroscopic analysis using integral field spectrographs. We aim to refine the atmospheric properties of this and to further constrain the architecture of the system by searching for additional companions. Using the SPHERE instrument at the VLT we extend the spectral coverage of the planet to the complete Y- to H-band range and provide photometry in the K12-bands (2.11, 2.25 micron). The object is compared to other cool and peculiar dwarfs. Furthermore, the posterior probability distributions of cloudy and clear atmospheric models are explored using MCMC. We verified our methods by determining atmospheric parameters for the two benchmark brown dwarfs Gl 570D and HD 3651B. For probing the innermost region for additional companions, archival VLT-NACO (L') SAM data is used. We present the first spectrophotometric measurements in the Y- and K-bands for the planet and revise its J-band flux to values 40{\%} fainter than previous measurements. Cloudy models with uniform cloud coverage provide a good match to the data. We derive the temperature, radius, surface gravity, metallicity and cloud sedimentation parameter f{\_}sed. We find that the atmosphere is highly super-solar (Fe/H{\~{}}1.0) with an extended, thick cloud cover of small particles. The model radius and surface gravity suggest planetary masses of about 9 M{\_}jup. The evolutionary model only provides a lower mass limit of {\textgreater}2 M{\_}jup (for pure hot-start). The cold-start model cannot explain the planet's luminosity. The SPHERE and NACO/SAM detection limits probe the 51 Eri system at Solar System scales and exclude brown-dwarf companions more massive than 20 M{\_}jup beyond separations of {\~{}}2.5 au and giant planets more massive than 2 M{\_}jup beyond 9 au.},

abstract = {We present the results of a search for potential transit signals in the full 17-quarter data set collected during Kepler's primary mission that ended on May 11, 2013, due to the on-board failure of a second reaction wheel needed to maintain high precision, fixed, pointing. The search includes a total of 198,646 targets, of which 112,001 were observed in every quarter and 86,645 were observed in a subset of the 17 quarters. We find a total of 12,669 targets that contain at least one signal that meets our detection criteria: periodicity of the signal, a minimum of three transit events, an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and four consistency tests that suppress false positives. Each target containing at least one transit-like pulse sequence is searched repeatedly for other signals that meet the detection criteria, indicating a multiple planet system. This multiple planet search adds an additional 7,698 transit-like signatures for a total of 20,367. Comparison of this set of detected signals with a set of known and vetted transiting planet signatures in the Kepler field of view shows that the recovery rate of the search is 90.3{\%}. We review ensemble properties of the detected signals and present various metrics useful in validating these potential planetary signals. We highlight previously undetected planetary candidates, including several small potential planets in the habitable zone of their host stars.},

GPI data include both polarized intensity and total intensity imagery, and MagAO data are taken in Simultaneous Differential Imaging mode at H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}. The new GPI H -band total intensity data represent a significant enhancement in sensitivity and field rotation compared to previous data sets and enable a detailed exploration of substructure in the disk. The data are processed with a variety of differential imaging techniques (polarized, angular, reference, and simultaneous differential imaging) in an attempt to identify the disk structures that are most consistent across wavelengths, processing techniques, and algorithmic parameters. The inner disk cavity at 15 au is clearly resolved in multiple datasets, as are a variety of spiral features. While the cavity and spiral structures are identified at levels significantly distinct from the neighboring regions of the disk under several algorithms and with a range of algorithmic parameters, emission at the location of HD 100546 c varies from point-like under aggressive algorithmic parameters to a smooth continuous structure with conservative parameters, and is consistent with disk emission. Features identified in the HD100546 disk bear qualitative similarity to computational models of a moderately inclined two-armed spiral disk, where projection effects and wrapping of the spiral arms around the star result in a number of truncated spiral features in forward-modeled images.},

abstract = {We present new JHK spectroscopy (R {\~{}} 5000) of GQ Lup b, acquired with the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph and the adaptive optics system ALTAIR at the Gemini North telescope. Angular differential imaging was used in the J and H bands to suppress the speckle noise from GQ Lup A; we show that this approach can provide improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) by a factor of 2-6 for companions located at subarcsecond separations. Based on high-quality observations and Global Astrometric lnterferometer for Astrophysics synthetic spectra, we estimate the companion effective temperature to T eff = 2400 ± 100 K, its gravity to log g = 4.0 ± 0.5, and its luminosity to log(L/L ☉) = –2.47 ± 0.28. Comparisons with the predictions of the DUSTY evolutionary tracks allow us to constrain the mass of GQ Lup b to 8-60 M Jup, most likely in the brown dwarf regime. Compared with the spectra published by Seifahrt and collaborators, our spectra of GQ Lup b are significantly redder (by 15{\%}-50{\%}) and do not show important Pa$\beta$ emission. Our spectra are in excellent agreement with the lower S/N spectra previously published by McElwain and collaborators.},

abstract = {High-contrast scattered light observations have revealed the surface morphology of several dozens of protoplanetary disks at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Inclined disks offer the opportunity to measure part of the phase function of the dust grains that reside in the disk surface which is essential for our understanding of protoplanetary dust properties and the early stages of planet formation. We aim to construct a method which takes into account how the flaring shape of the scattering surface of an (optically thick) protoplanetary disk projects onto the image plane of the observer. This allows us to map physical quantities (scattering radius and scattering angle) onto scattered light images and retrieve stellar irradiation corrected (r{\^{}}2-scaled) images and dust phase functions. We apply the method on archival polarized intensity images of the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546 that were obtained with VLT/SPHERE in R'-band and VLT/NACO in H- and Ks-band. The brightest side of the r{\^{}}2-scaled R'-band polarized intensity image of HD 100546 changes from the far to the near side of the disk when a flaring instead of a geometrically flat disk surface is used for the r{\^{}}2-scaling. The decrease in polarized surface brightness in the scattering angle range of {\~{}}40-70 deg is likely a result of the dust phase function and degree of polarization which peak in different scattering angle regimes. The derived phase functions show part of a forward scattering peak which indicates that large, aggregate dust grains dominate the scattering opacity in the disk surface. Projection effects of a protoplanetary disk surface need to be taken into account to correctly interpret scattered light images. Applying the correct scaling for the correction of stellar irradiation is crucial for the interpretation of the images and the derivation of the dust properties in the disk surface layer.},

abstract = {The nature of the vertical thermal structure of hot Jupiter atmospheres is one of the key questions raised by the characterization of transiting exoplanets over the last decade. There have been claims that many hot Jupiter's exhibit vertical profiles with increasing temperature with decreasing pressure in the infrared photosphere that leads to the reversal of molecular absorption bands into emission features (an inversion). However, these claims have been based on broadband photometry rather than the unambiguous identification of emission features with spectroscopy, and the chemical species that could cause the thermal inversions by absorbing stellar irradiation at high altitudes have not been identified despite extensive theoretical and observational effort. Here we present high precision HST WFC3 observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD209458b; the first exoplanet suggested to have a thermal inversion. Our observations resolve a water band in absorption at 6.2 sigma confidence. When combined with Spitzer photometry the data are indicative of a monotonically decreasing temperature with pressure over the range 1-0.001 bar at 7.7 sigma confidence. We test the robustness of our results by exploring a variety of model assumptions including the temperature profile parameterization, presence of a cloud, and choice of Spitzer data reduction. We also introduce a new analysis method, "chemical retrieval-on-retrieval", to determine the elemental abundances from the spectrally retrieved mixing ratios with thermochemical self-consistency and find plausible abundances consistent with solar metallicity (0.06 - 10 x solar) and carbon-to-oxygen ratios less than unity. This work suggests that high-precision spectrophotometric results are required to robustly infer thermal structures and compositions of extra-solar planet atmospheres.},

With an equilibrium temperature of about 4,050 kelvin4, the exoplanet KELT-9b (also known as HD 195689b) is an archetype of the class of ultrahot Jupiters that straddle the transition between stars and gas-giant exoplanets and are therefore useful for studying atmospheric chemistry. At these high temperatures, iron and several other transition metals are not sequestered in molecules or cloud particles and exist solely in their atomic forms5. However, despite being the most abundant transition metal in nature, iron has not hitherto been detected directly in an exoplanet because it is highly refractory. The high temperatures of KELT-9b imply that its atmosphere is a tightly constrained chemical system that is expected to be nearly in chemical equilibrium5 and cloud-free6,7, and it has been predicted that spectral lines of iron should be detectable in the visible range of wavelengths5. Here we report observations of neutral and singly ionized atomic iron (Fe and Fe+) and singly ionized atomic titanium (Ti+) in the atmosphere of KELT-9b. We identify these species using cross-correlation analysis8 of high-resolution spectra obtained as the exoplanet passed in front of its host star. Similar detections of metals in other ultrahot Jupiters will provide constraints for planetary formation theories.},

abstract = {Planetary rotation rates and obliquities provide information regarding the history of planet formation, but have not yet been measured for evolved extrasolar planets. Here we investigate the theoretical and observational perspective of the Rossiter-McLauglin effect during secondary eclipse (RMse) ingress and egress for transiting exoplanets. Near secondary eclipse, when the planet passes behind the parent star, the star sequentially obscures light from the approaching and receding parts of the rotating planetary surface. The temporal block of light emerging from the approaching (blue-shifted) or receding (red-shifted) parts of the planet causes a temporal distortion in the planet's spectral line profiles resulting in an anomaly in the planet's radial velocity curve. We demonstrate that the shape and the ratio of the ingress-to-egress radial velocity amplitudes depends on the planetary rotational rate, axial tilt and impact factor (i.e. sky-projected planet spin-orbital alignment). In addition, line asymmetries originating from different layers in the atmosphere of the planet could provide information regarding zonal atmospheric winds and constraints on the hot spot shape for giant irradiated exoplanets. The effect is expected to be most-pronounced at near-infrared wavelengths, where the planet-to-star contrasts are large. We create synthetic near-infrared, high-dispersion spectroscopic data and demonstrate how the sky-projected spin axis orientation and equatorial velocity of the planet can be estimated. We conclude that the RMse effect could be a powerful method to measure exoplanet spins.},

abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is nearing its launch date of 2018, and will undoubtedly revolutionize our knowledge of exoplanet atmospheres. While several studies have explored what the limits of the telescope will be in terms of exoplanet characterization, less has been done to specifically identify which observing modes will be most useful for characterizing a diverse range of exoplanetary atmospheres. We use an information content based approach commonly used in the studies of Solar System atmospheres. We develop a system based upon these information content methods to trace the instrumental and atmospheric model phase space in order to identify which observing modes are best suited for particular classes of planets, focusing on transmission spectra. Specifically, the atmospheric parameter space we cover is T=600-1800 K, C/O=0.55-1, [M/H]=1-100{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}Solar for a R=1.39 R{\$}{\_}J{\$}, M=0.59 M{\$}{\_}J{\$} planet orbiting WASP-62-like star. We find that obtaining broader wavelength coverage over multiple modes is preferred over higher precision in a single mode given the same amount of observing time. Regardless of the planet temperature and composition, the best modes for constraining terminator temperatures, C/O ratios, and metalicity are NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. If the target's host star is dim enough such that the NIRSpec prism can be used, then it cam be used instead of NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. Lastly, observations that use more than two modes, should be carefully analyzed because sometimes the addition of a third mode results in no gain of information. In these cases, higher precision in the original two modes is favorable.},

This survey used nonredundant aperture mask interferometry to achieve typical contrast limits of $\Delta$K{\~{}}5-6 at the diffraction limit, revealing 12 new binary companions that lay below the detection limits of traditional high-resolution imaging; we also summarize a complementary snapshot imaging survey that discovered seven directly resolved companions. The overall frequency of binary companions ({\~{}}35+5-4{\%} at separations of 6-435 AU) appears to be equivalent to field stars of similar mass, but companions could be more common among lower mass stars than for the field. The companion mass function has statistically significant differences compared to several suggested mass functions for the field, and we suggest an alternate lognormal parameterization of the mass function. Our survey limits encompass the entire brown dwarf mass range, but we only detected a single companion that might be a brown dwarf; this deficit resembles the so-called brown dwarf desert that has been observed by radial velocity planet searches. Finally, our survey's deep detection limits extend into the top of the planetary mass function, reaching 8-12 MJup for half of our sample. We have not identified any planetary companions at high confidence ({\textgreater}{\~{}}99.5{\%}), but we have identified four candidate companions at lower confidence ({\textgreater}{\~{}}97.5{\%}) that merit additional follow-up to confirm or disprove their existence.},

Using the best available astrometry, our simulations suggest that the probability that the star penetrated the outer Oort Cloud is {\$}\backslashsim{\$}98{\%}, but the probability of penetrating the dynamically active inner Oort Cloud ({\$}{\textless}{\$}20 kAU) is {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$}. While the flyby of this system likely caused negligible impact on the flux of long-period comets, the recent discovery of this binary highlights that dynamically important Oort Cloud perturbers may be lurking among nearby stars.},

abstract = {WISE J104915.57-531906.1 is the nearest brown dwarf binary to our Solar system, consisting of two brown dwarfs in the L/T transition: Luhman 16A {\&} B. In this paper we present the first map of Luhman 16A, and maps of Luhman 16B for two epochs. Our maps were created by applying Aeolus, a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo code that maps the top-of-the-atmosphere structure of brown dwarf and other ultracool atmospheres, to light curves of Luhman 16A {\&} B using the Hubble Space Telescope's G141 and G102 grisms. Aeolus retrieved three or four spots in the top-of-the-atmosphere of Luhman 16A {\&} B, with a surface coverage of 19{\%}-32{\%} (depending on an assumed rotational period of 5 hr or 8 hr) or 21{\%}-38.5{\%} (depending on the observational epoch) respectively. The brightness temperature of the spots of the best-fit models was {\~{}}200 K hotter than the background top-of-the-atmosphere. We compared our Luhman 16B map with the only previously published map. Interestingly, our map contained a large, cooler (DT{\~{}}51 K) than the background top-of-the-atmosphere spot that lay at low latitudes, in agreement with the previous Luhman 16B map. Finally, we report the detection of a feature reappearing in Luhman 16B light curves that are separated by tens of hundreds of rotations from each other. We speculate this feature is related to top-of-the-atmosphere structures of Luhman 16B.},

abstract = {We report resolved near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry of the recently identified brown dwarf binary WISE J104915.57-531906.1AB, located 2.02+/-0.15 pc from the Sun. Low-resolution spectral data from Magellan/FIRE and IRTF/SpeX reveal strong H2O and CO absorption features in the spectra of both components, with the secondary also exhibiting weak CH4 absorption at 1.6 micron and 2.2 micron. Spectral indices and comparison to low-resolution spectral standards indicate component types of L7.5 and T0.5, the former consistent with the optical classification of the primary. Relative photometry reveals a flux reversal between the J- and K-bands, with the T dwarf component being brighter in the 0.95--1.3 micron range. As with other L/T transition binaries, this reversal likely reflects significant depletion of condensate opacity across the transition, a behavior that may be enhanced in WISE J1049-5319AB if the unusual red color of its L dwarf component is indicative of thick clouds. On the other hand, differing cloud properties may have modified the evolutionary paths of these two components, and we propose a scenario in which the cooler secondary could be the more massive of the two components. Fortunately, the proximity, brightness and small separation (3.12+/-0.25 AU) of this system make it amenable to astrometric and radial velocity orbit measurement during its estimated 25 yr orbit, providing a rare opportunity for the direct determination of individual brown dwarf masses and a unique benchmark for studying cloud evolution across the L dwarf/T dwarf transition.},

abstract = {Many brown dwarfs (BDs) exhibit photometric variability at levels from tenths to tens of percents. The photometric variability is related to magnetic activity or patchy cloud coverage, characteristic of BDs near the L-T transition. Time-resolved spectral monitoring of BDs provides diagnostics of cloud distribution and condensate properties. However, current time-resolved spectral studies of BDs are limited to low spectral resolution (R∼100) with the exception of the study of Luhman 16 AB at aresolution of 100,000 using the VLT+CRIRES. This work yielded the first map of BD surface inhomogeneity, highlighting the importance and unique contribution of high spectral resolution observations. Here, we report on the time-resolved high spectral resolution observations of a nearby BD binary, 2MASSW J0746425+200032AB. We find no coherent spectral variability that is modulated with rotation. Based on simulations, we conclude that the coverage of a single spot on 2MASSW J0746425 +200032AB is smaller than 1{\%} or 6.25{\%} if spot contrast is 50{\%} or 80{\%} of its surrounding flux, respectively. Future high spectral resolution observations aided by adaptive optics systems can put tighter constraints on the spectral variability of 2MASSW J0746425+200032AB and other nearby BDs.},

abstract = {We observed Jupiter at wavelengths near 2 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in February 2015. These frequencies are mostly sensitive to variations in ammonia abundance and probe between {\~{}}0.5-2.0 bars of pressure in Jupiter's atmosphere; within and below the visible cloud deck which has its base near 0.7 bars. The resultant observed data were projected into a cylindrical map of the planet with spatial resolution of {\~{}}1500 km at the equator. We have examined the data for atmospheric waves and observed a prominent bright belt of radio hotspot features near 10N, likely connected to the same equatorial wave associated with the 5-micron hotspots. We conducted a passive tracer power spectral wave analysis for the entire map. The power spectra analysis revealed that the atmosphere sampled in our observation (excluding the NEB region) is in a 2-D turbulent regime and its dynamics are predominately governed by the shallow water equations. The GRS is also very prominent and has a noticeable meridional asymmetry and we compare it, and nearby storms, with optical images. We find that the meridional radio profile has a global north-south hemisphere distinction and find correlations of it to optical intensity banding and to shear zones of the zonal wind profile over select regions of latitude. Amateur optical images taken before and after our observation complemented the radio wavelength map to investigate dynamics of the equatorial region in Jupiter's atmosphere. We find that two radio hotspots at 2 cm are well correlated with optical plumes in the NEB, additionally revealing they are not the same 5 micron hotspot features correlated with optical dark patches between adjacent plumes. This analysis exploits the VLA's upgraded sensitivity and explores the opportunities now possible when studying gas giants, especially atmospheric dynamics of layers beneath upper level clouds.},

abstract = {We present results from the Weather on Other Worlds Spitzer Exploration Science program to investigate photometric variability in L and T dwarfs, usually attributed to patchy clouds. We surveyed 44 L3-T8 dwarfs, spanning a range of J – Ks colors and surface gravities. We find that 14/23 (, 95{\%} confidence) of our single L3-L9.5 dwarfs are variable with peak-to-peak amplitudes between 0.2{\%} and 1.5{\%}, and 5/16 () of our single T0-T8 dwarfs are variable with amplitudes between 0.8{\%} and 4.6{\%}. After correcting for sensitivity, we find that of L dwarfs vary by ≥0.2{\%}, and of T dwarfs vary by ≥0.4{\%}. Given viewing geometry considerations, we conclude that photospheric heterogeneities causing {\textgreater}0.2{\%} 3-5 $\mu$m flux variations are present on virtually all L dwarfs, and probably on most T dwarfs. A third of L dwarf variables show irregular light curves, indicating that L dwarfs may have multiple spots that evolve over a single rotation. Also, approximately a third of the periodicities are on timescales {\textgreater}10 hr, suggesting that slowly rotating brown dwarfs may be common. We observe an increase in the maximum amplitudes over the entire spectral type range, revealing a potential for greater temperature contrasts in T dwarfs than in L dwarfs. We find a tentative association (92{\%} confidence) between low surface gravity and high-amplitude variability among L3-L5.5 dwarfs. Although we can not confirm whether lower gravity is also correlated with a higher incidence of variables, the result is promising for the characterization of directly imaged young extrasolar planets through variability.},

abstract = {One proposed method for spacecraft to reach nearby stars is by accelerating sails using either solar radiation pressure or beamed lasers. This idea constitutes the thesis behind the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, which aims to accelerate a gram-mass spacecraft up to one-fifth the speed of light towards Proxima Centauri. For such a case, the spacecraft's low mass and relativistic terminal velocity render classical treatments invalid. To address this, we present formulae for a sail's acceleration, first in response to a single photon and then extended to an ensemble. We show how the sail's motion in response to an ensemble of incident photons is well-described by that of a single high energy photon for both elastic and inelastic collisions, enabling a simple analytic prediction of the sail's velocity curve. Using our results and adopting putative parameters for Starshot, we estimate that a classical treatment would overestimate the spacecraft's terminal velocity by {\~{}}10{\%} for the same incident energy. Additionally, we use a simple model to predict to the temperature of the sail during the laser firing period, allowing us to estimate that for firing times less than 4 hours and operating temperatures below {\$}300{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C ({\$}573{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}K), Starshot will require a sail of reflectivity better than 99.99{\%}.},

abstract = {Planets in the habitable zone of lower-mass stars are often assumed to be in a state of tidally synchronized rotation, which would considerably affect their putative habitability. Although thermal tides cause Venus to rotate retrogradely, simple scaling arguments tend to attribute this peculiarity to the massive Venusian atmosphere. Using a global climate model, we show that even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets' rotation away from synchronicity. We derive a more realistic atmospheric tide model that predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states, two being stable, when the amplitude of the thermal tide exceeds a threshold that is met for habitable Earth-like planets with a 1-bar atmosphere around stars more massive than 0.5-0.7Msun. Thus, many recently discovered terrestrial planets could exhibit asynchronous spin-orbit rotation, even with a thin atmosphere.},

abstract = {The determination of atmospheric structure and molecular abundances of planetary atmospheres via spectroscopy involves direct comparisons between models and data. While varying in sophistication, most model spectra comparisons fundamentally assume one-dimensional (1D) model physics. However, knowledge from general circulation models and of solar system planets suggests that planetary atmospheres are inherently three-dimensional in their structure and composition. We explore the potential biases resulting from standard "1D" assumptions within a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework. Specifically, we show how the assumption of a single 1D thermal profile can bias our interpretation of the thermal emission spectrum of a hot Jupiter atmosphere that is composed of two thermal profiles. We retrieve spectra of unresolved model planets as observed with a combination of the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)+Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) as well as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) under varying differences in the two thermal profiles. For WFC3+IRAC, there is a significantly biased estimate of CH 4 abundance using a 1D model when the contrast is 80{\%}. For JWST, two thermal profiles are required to adequately interpret the data and estimate the abundances when contrast is greater than 40{\%}. We also apply this preliminary concept to the recent WFC3+IRAC phase curve data of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b. We see similar behavior as present in our simulated data: while the H O 2 abundance determination is robust, CH 4 is artificially well-constrained to incorrect values under the 1D assumption. Our work demonstrates the need to evaluate model assumptions in order to extract meaningful constraints from atmospheric spectra and motivates exploration of optimal observational setups.},

abstract = {As part of a national scientific network 'Pathways to Habitability' the formation of planets and the delivery of water onto these planets is a key question as water is essential for the development of life. In the first part of the paper we summarize the state of the art of planet formation - which is still under debate in the astronomical community - before we show our results on this topic. The outcome of our numerical simulations depends a lot on the choice of the initial distribution of planetesimals and planetary embryos after gas disappeared in the protoplanetary disk. We also take into account that some of these planetesimals of sizes in the order of the mass of the Moon already contained water; the quantity depends on the distance from the Sun - close-by bodies are dry, but starting from a distance of about 2 AU they can contain substantial amounts of water. We assume that the gas giants and terrestrial planets are already formed when we check the collisions of the small bodies containing water (in the order of a few percent) with the terrestrial planets. We thus are able to give an estimate of the respective contribution to the actual water content (of some Earth-oceans) in the mantle, in the crust and on the surface of Earth. In the second part we discuss in more detail how the formation of larger bodies after a collision may happen as the outcome depends on parameters like collision velocity, impact angle, and the materials involved. We present results obtained by SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) simulations. We briefly describe this method and show different scenarios with respect to the formed bodies, possible fragmentation and the water content before and after the collision. In an appendix we discuss detection methods for extrasolar planets (close to 2000 such objects have been discovered so far).},

Furthermore, we resolve the inner disk for the first time and trace it out to 30 AU. This new source of scattered light may contribute to the near-infrared interferometric signal attributed to the protoplanet candidate LkCa 15 b, which lies embedded in the outer regions of the inner disk. Finally, we present a new model for the system architecture of LkCa 15 that ties these new findings together.

abstract = {Presently, dedicated instruments at large telescopes (SPHERE for the VLT, GPI for Gemini) are about to discover and explore self-luminous giant planets by direct imaging and spectroscopy. The next generation of 30m-40m ground-based telescopes, the Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), have the potential to dramatically enlarge the discovery space towards older giant planets seen in reflected light and ultimately even a small number of rocky planets. EPICS is a proposed instrument for the European ELT, dedicated to the detection and characterization of Exoplanets by direct imaging, spectroscopy and polarimetry. ESO completed a phase-A study for EPICS with a large European consortium which - by simulations and demonstration experiments - investigated state-of-the-art diffraction and speckle suppression techniques to deliver highest contrasts. The paper presents the instrument concept and analysis as well as its main innovations and science capabilities. EPICS is capable of discovering hundreds of giant planets, and dozens of lower mass planets down to the rocky planets domain. Keywords:},

abstract = {We calculate the abundances of electrons and ions in the hot ({\textgreater} 500 K), dusty parts of protoplanetary disks, treating for the first time the effects of thermionic and ion emission from the dust grains. High-temperature ionization modeling has involved simply assuming that alkali elements such as potassium occur as gas-phase atoms and are collisionally ionized following the Saha equation. We show that the Saha equation often does not hold, because free charges are produced by thermionic and ion emission and destroyed when they stick to grain surfaces. This means the ionization state depends not on the first ionization potential of the alkali atoms, but rather on the grains' work functions. The charged species' abundances typically rise abruptly above about 800 K, with little qualitative dependence on the work function, gas density, or dust-to-gas mass ratio. Applying our results, we find that protoplanetary disks' dead zone, where high diffusivities stifle magnetorotational turbulence, has its inner edge located where the temperature exceeds a threshold value {\~{}}1000 K. The threshold is set by ambipolar diffusion except at the highest densities, where it is set by Ohmic resistivity. We find that the disk gas can be diffusively loaded onto the stellar magnetosphere at temperatures below a similar threshold. We investigate whether the "short-circuit" instability of current sheets can operate in disks and find that it cannot, or works only in a narrow range of conditions; it appears not to be the chondrule formation mechanism. We also suggest that thermionic emission is important for determining the rate of Ohmic heating in hot Jupiters.},

abstract = {We report near-infrared measurements of the terminator region transmission spectrum and dayside emission spectrum of the exoplanet WASP-12b obtained using the HST WFC3 instrument. The disk-average dayside brightness temperature averages about 2900K, peaking to 3200K around 1.46$\mu$m. We modeled a range of atmospheric cases for both the emission and transmission spectrum and confirm the recent finding by Crossfield et al. (Crossfield, I., Barman, T., Hansen, B., Tanaka, I., Kodama, T. [2012b]. arXiv: 1210.4836C) that there is no evidence for C/O{\textgreater}1 in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. Assuming a physically plausible atmosphere, we find evidence that the presence of a number of molecules is consistent with the data, but the justification for inclusion of these opacity sources based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is marginal. We also find the near-infrared primary eclipse light curve is consistent with small amounts of prolate distortion. As part of the calibration effort for these data, we conducted a detailed study of instrument systematics using 65 orbits of WFC3-IR grims observations. The instrument systematics are dominated by detector-related affects, which vary significantly depending on the detector readout mode. The 256×256 subarray observations of WASP-12 produced spectral measurements within 15{\%} of the photon-noise limit using a simple calibration approach. Residual systematics are estimated to be ⩽70ppm.},

abstract = {Recognizing whether a planet can support life is a primary goal of future exoplanet spectral characterization missions, but past research on habitability assessment has largely ignored the vastly different conditions that have existed in our planet's long habitable history. This study presents simulations of a habitable yet dramatically different phase of Earth's history, when the atmosphere contained a Titan-like organic-rich haze. Prior work has claimed a haze-rich Archean Earth (3.8-2.5 billion years ago) would be frozen due to the haze's cooling effects. However, no previous studies have self-consistently taken into account climate, photochemistry, and fractal hazes. Here, we demonstrate using coupled climate-photochemical-microphysical simulations that hazes can cool the planet's surface by about 20 K, but habitable conditions with liquid surface water could be maintained with a relatively thick haze layer (tau {\~{}} 5 at 200 nm) even with the fainter young sun. We find that optically thicker hazes are self-limiting due to their self-shielding properties, preventing catastrophic cooling of the planet. Hazes may even enhance planetary habitability through UV shielding, reducing surface UV flux by about 97{\%} compared to a haze-free planet, and potentially allowing survival of land-based organisms 2.6.2.7 billion years ago. The broad UV absorption signature produced by this haze may be visible across interstellar distances, allowing characterization of similar hazy exoplanets. The haze in Archean Earth's atmosphere was strongly dependent on biologically-produced methane, and we propose hydrocarbon haze may be a novel type of spectral biosignature on planets with substantial levels of CO2. Hazy Archean Earth is the most alien world for which we have geochemical constraints on environmental conditions, providing a useful analog for similar habitable, anoxic exoplanets.},

abstract = {Our Keck/NIRC2 imaging survey searches for stellar companions around 144 systems with radial velocity (RV) detected giant planets to determine whether stellar binaries influence the planets' orbital parameters. This survey, the largest of its kind to date, finds eight confirmed binary systems and three confirmed triple systems. These include three new multi-stellar systems (HD 30856, HD 86081, and HD 207832) and three multi-stellar systems with newly confirmed common proper motion (HD 43691, HD 116029, and HD 164509). We combine these systems with seven RV planet-hosting multi-stellar systems from the literature in order to test for differences in the properties of planets with semimajor axes ranging between 0.1-5 au in single vs multi-stellar systems. We find no evidence that the presence or absence of stellar companions alters the distribution of planet properties in these systems. Although the observed stellar companions might influence the orbits of more distant planetary companions in these systems, our RV observations currently provide only weak constraints on the masses and orbital properties of planets beyond 5 au. In order to aid future efforts to characterize long period RV companions in these systems, we publish our contrast curves for all 144 targets. Using four years of astrometry for six hierarchical triple star systems hosting giant planets, we fit the orbits of the stellar companions in order to characterize the orbital architecture in these systems. We find that the orbital plane of the secondary and tertiary companions are inconsistent with an edge-on orbit in four out of six cases.},

We confronted the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. Theoretical masses were related to {\$}K{\_}S{\$}-band luminosities and compared to a relation developed from astrometric binaries. Model masses agree well with the empirical relation, with a notable offset at {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\$}{\textgreater}0.55{\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The best-agreement models over-predict stellar {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}eff{\}}{\}}{\$}s by an average of 2.2{\%} and under-predict stellar radii by 4.6{\%}, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions e.g., opacities, helium mass fraction, or convective mixing length.},

abstract = {Doppler imaging spectroscopy is the most reliable way to directly measure wind speeds of planetary atmospheres of the Solar system. However, most knowledge about atmospheric dynamics has been obtained with cloud-tracking technique, which consists of tracking visible features from images taken at different dates. Doppler imaging is as challenging – motions can be less than 100 m s −1 – as appealing because it measures the speed of cloud particles instead of large cloud structures. Significant difference is expected in case of atmospheric waves interfering with cloud structures. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical basis for conducting accurate Doppler measurements of planetary atmospheres, especially from the ground with reflected solar absorption lines. We focus on three aspects which lead to significant biases. Firstly, we fully review the Young effect, which is an artificial radial velocity field caused by the solar rotation that mimics a retrograde planetary rotation. Secondly, we extensively study the impact of atmospheric seeing and show that it modifies the apparent location of the planet in the sky whenever the planet is not observed at full phase (opposition). Besides, the seeing convolves regions of variable radial velocity and photometry, which biases radial-velocity measurements, by reducing the apparent amplitude of atmospheric motions. Finally, we propose a method to interpret data, i.e., how to retrieve zonal, meridional, vertical, and subsolar-to-antisolar circulation from radial velocity maps, by optimizing the signal to noise ratio.},

We present the first high-contrast images at H$\alpha$ (656 nm) and nearby continuum (643 nm) of PDS 70 utilizing the MagAO system. The combination of these filters allows for the accretion rate of the young planet to be inferred, as hot infalling hydrogen gas will emit strongly at H$\alpha$ over the optical continuum. We detected a source in H$\alpha$ at the position of PDS 70b on two sequential nights in 2018 May, for which we establish a false positive probability of {\textless}0.1{\%}. We conclude that PDS 70b is a young, actively accreting planet. We utilize the H$\alpha$ line luminosity to derive a mass accretion rate of M 10 8 1 =- ˙ M Jup yr −1 , where the large uncertainty is primarily due to the unknown amount of optical extinction from the circumstellar and circumplanetary disks.

abstract = {Afterglows of earlier exposures, a phenomenon known as persistence, are seen in some images taken with the IR detector on WFC3. The amount of persistence is almost cer-tainly a function of the complete exposure history of a pixel in the detector. However, the model currently being used to predict persistence in the IR channel of WFC3 de-pends solely on fluence associated with an earlier exposure and the time since that exposure. Here we describe the development of an improved model of persistence based on analysis of a set of observations of Omega Cen and 47 Tuc. We compare two similar parameterizations of persistence, both of which add the exposure time of the earlier ex-posure as an additional factor in the persistence prediction. We quantify the degree to which these two parameterizations improve our ability to predict persistence in WFC3 IR observations. The new parameterizations have been incorporated into the software package that is used to predict persistence in all WFC3 IR observations.},

abstract = {We present the first observations of a probable brown dwarf, obtained with the new spectrograph X-shooter mounted on the UT2@VLT. The target (2MASS J053825.4-024241) is a 0.06 M{\_}⊙ object in the star-formation region $\sigma$ Ori. The X-shooter spectrum covers simultaneously the whole range from UV to NIR (300-2500 nm). The J053825.4-024241 spectrum is rich in emission lines that are typical of accreting young object and clearly shows the Balmer jump. Moreover, many photospheric atomic and molecular absorption lines yield the spectral type and confirm that the object is young. We compute the mass accretion rate from all available observed accretion diagnostics. We find that there is a large spread in the dot M{\_}acc values (up to a factor 40) that is not caused by variability; some of this spread may be intrinsic, i.e., owing to different physical conditions of the emitting region for the same dot M{\_}acc. However, within the large error bars all dot M{\_}acc measurements agree, and the mean value is log dot M{\_}acc -9.86 ± 0.45 M{\_}⊙/y. The hydrogen Balmer lines are clearly detected up to n = 25. Their ratios suggest that the emitting region is cold (T 2000-3000 K), dense and in thermal equilibrium (LTE), and that the lines are optically thick up to n 21. We briefly discuss the implications of this result for magnetospheric accretion models. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile. Program 084.C-0269(A).},

abstract = {HAT-P-20b is a giant exoplanet that orbits a metal-rich star. The planet itself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a high metallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of the 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel detector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional decorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically different method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which we call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect very effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the fluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and validate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to previous analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in Spitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be intractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b eclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating inefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong molecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5 micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by Spitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All four eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a slightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with extant RV data yields e(cos{\{}omega{\}}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), and establishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence. Given the existence of a bound stellar companion, HAT-P-20b is another excellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other three-body mechanism.},

abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90{\%} of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If hot Neptunes have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of {\~{}}0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are {\~{}}40{\%}-50{\%} larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.},

abstract = {Context: Accretion and outflow processes are of fundamental importance for our understanding of the formation of stars and planetary systems. To trace these processes, diagnostic spectral lines such as the Br$\gamma$ 2.166 $\mu$m line are widely used, although due to a lack of spatial resolution, the origin of the line emission is still unclear. Aims: Employing the AU-scale spatial resolution which can be achieved with infrared long-baseline interferometry, we aim to distinguish between theoretical models which associate the Br$\gamma$ line emission with mass infall (magnetospheric accretion, gaseous inner disks) or mass outflow processes (stellar winds, X-winds, or disk winds).  Methods: Using the VLTI/AMBER instrument, we spatially and spectrally ($\lambda$/$\Delta$$\lambda$ = 1500) resolved the inner (⪉5 AU) environment of five Herbig Ae/Be stars (HD 163296, HD 104237, HD 98922, MWC 297, V921 Sco) in the Br$\gamma$ emission line as well as in the adjacent continuum. From the measured wavelength-dependent visibilities, we derive the characteristic size of the continuum and Br$\gamma$ line-emitting region. Additional information is provided by the closure phase, which we could measure both in the continuum wavelength regime (for four objects) as well as in the spectrally resolved Br$\gamma$ emission line (for one object). The spectro-interferometric data is supplemented by archival and new VLT/ISAAC spectroscopy.  Results: For all objects (except MWC 297), we measure an increase of visibility within the Br$\gamma$ emission line, indicating that the Br$\gamma$-emitting region in these objects is more compact than the dust sublimation radius. For HD 98922, our quantitative analysis reveals that the line-emitting region is compact enough to be consistent with the magnetospheric accretion scenario. For HD 163296, HD 104237, MWC 297, and V921 Sco we identify an extended stellar wind or a disk wind as the most likely line-emitting mechanism. Since the stars in our sample cover a wide range of stellar parameters, we also search for general trends and find that the size of the Br$\gamma$-emitting region does not seem to depend on the basic stellar parameters (such as the stellar luminosity), but correlates with spectroscopic properties, in particular with the H$\alpha$ line profile shape.  Conclusions: By performing the first high-resolution spectro-interferometric survey on Herbig Ae/Be stars, we find evidence for at least two distinct Br$\gamma$ line-formation mechanisms. Most significant, stars with a P-Cygni H$\alpha$ line profile and a high mass-accretion rate seem to show particularly compact Br$\gamma$-emitting regions (RBr$\gamma$/Rcont {\textless} 0.2), while stars with a double-peaked or single-peaked H$\alpha$-line profile show a significantly more extended Br$\gamma$-emitting region (0.6 ⪉ RBr$\gamma$/Rcont ⪉ 1.4), possibly tracing a stellar wind or a disk wind.

We have found that this hot white dwarf (T eff 22 640 K) is in a very close orbit (P 71 min) with a star of near brown-dwarf mass 0.061 M . This period is very close to, or somewhat below, the minimum orbital period of cataclysmic variables with H-rich donor stars. However, we find no evidence that this binary is currently, or ever was, transferring mass from the low-mass companion to the white dwarf. We therefore tentatively conclude that this system is still in the pre-cataclysmic variable phase, having emerged from a common envelope some 50 ± 20 Myr ago. Because of the 29-min integration time of K2, we use follow-up ground-based photometry to better evaluate the eclipsing light curve. We also utilize the original SDSS spectra, in approximately 15-min segments, to estimate the radial velocity of the white dwarf in its orbit. An analysis of the light curve, with supplementary constraints, leads to the following system parameters: M wd 0.415 ± 0.028 M , R wd 0.021 ± 0.001 R , M com 0.061 ± 0.010 M and R com 0.088 ± 0.005 R where the subscripts 'wd' and 'com' refer to the white dwarf and low-mass companion, respectively. If our interpretation of this system as a pre-CV is correct, it has the shortest period of any such system yet found and should become a compact CV in less than 250 Myr.},

abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopy (R {\$}\backslashge{\$} 20 000) at near-infrared wavelengths can be used to investigate the composition, structure, and circulation patterns of exoplanet atmospheres. However, up to now it has been the exclusive dominion of the biggest telescope facilities on the ground, due to the large amount of photons necessary to measure a signal in high-dispersion spectra. Here we show that spectrographs with a novel design - in particular a large spectral range - can open exoplanet characterisation to smaller telescope facilities too. We aim at demonstrating the concept on a series of spectra of the exoplanet HD 189733 b taken at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo with the near-infrared spectrograph GIANO during two transits of the planet. In contrast to absorption in the Earth's atmosphere (telluric absorption), the planet transmission spectrum shifts in radial velocity during transit due to the changing orbital motion of the planet. This allows us to remove the telluric spectrum while preserving the signal of the exoplanet. The latter is then extracted by cross-correlating the residual spectra with template models of the planet atmosphere computed through line-by-line radiative transfer calculations, and containing molecular absorption lines from water and methane. By combining the signal of many thousands of planet molecular lines, we confirm the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b at the 5.5-{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} level. This signal was measured only in the first of the two observing nights. By injecting and retrieving artificial signals, we show that the non-detection on the second night is likely due to an inferior quality of the data. The measured strength of the planet transmission spectrum is fully consistent with past CRIRES observations at the VLT, excluding a strong variability in the depth of molecular absorption lines.},

abstract = {Motivated by the population of observed multi-planet systems with orbital period ratios 1 {\textless} P 2/P 1 lesssim 2, we study the long-term stability of packed two-planet systems. The Hamiltonian for two massive planets on nearly circular and nearly coplanar orbits near a first-order mean motion resonance can be reduced to a one-degree-of-freedom problem. Using this analytically tractable Hamiltonian, we apply the resonance overlap criterion to predict the onset of large-scale chaotic motion in close two-planet systems. The reduced Hamiltonian has only a weak dependence on the planetary mass ratio m 1/m 2, and hence the overlap criterion is independent of the planetary mass ratio at lowest order. Numerical integrations confirm that the planetary mass ratio has little effect on the structure of the chaotic phase space for close orbits in the low-eccentricity (e lesssim 0.1) regime. We show numerically that orbits in the chaotic web produced primarily by first-order resonance overlap eventually experience large-scale erratic variation in semimajor axes and are therefore Lagrange unstable. This is also true of the orbits in this overlap region which satisfy the Hill criterion. As a result, we can use the first-order resonance overlap criterion as an effective stability criterion for pairs of observed planets. We show that for low-mass (lesssim 10 M ⊕) planetary systems with initially circular orbits the period ratio at which complete overlap occurs and widespread chaos results lies in a region of parameter space which is Hill stable. Our work indicates that a resonance overlap criterion which would apply for initially eccentric orbits likely needs to take into account second-order resonances. Finally, we address the connection found in previous work between the Hill stability criterion and numerically determined Lagrange instability boundaries in the context of resonance overlap.},

abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets presents a formidable technical challenge owing to the small angular separation and high contrast between exoplanets and their host stars. High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) is a pathway to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. Here, we present a framework to simulate HDC observations and data analyses. The goal of these simulations is to perform a detailed analysis of the trade-off between raw star light suppression and spectral resolution for various instrument configurations, target types, and science cases. We predict the performance of an HDC instrument at Keck observatory for characterizing directly imaged gas-giant planets in near-infrared bands. We also simulate HDC observations of an Earth-like planet using next-generation ground-based (TMT) and spaced-base telescopes (HabEx and LUVOIR). We conclude that ground-based ELTs are more suitable for HDC observations of an Earth-like planet than future space-based missions owing to the considerable difference in collecting area. For ground-based telescopes, HDC observations can detect an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone around an M-dwarf star at 10 −4 star light suppression level. Compared to the 10 −7 planet/star contrast, HDC relaxes the star light suppression requirement by a factor of 10 3. For space-based telescopes, detector noise will be a major limitation at spectral resolutions higher than 10 4. Considering detector noise and speckle chromatic noise, R=400 (1600) is the optimal spectral resolutions for HabEx (LUVOIR). The corresponding star light suppression requirement to detect a planet with planet/star contrast=´-contrast=´contrast=´-6.1 10 11 is relaxed by a factor of 10 (100) for HabEx (LUVOIR).},

We report one new discovery of a {\~{}}14 M J companion around GSC 06214–00210and confirm that the candidate planetary-mass companion 1RXS J160929.1–210524 detected by Lafreni{\`{e}}re et al. is in fact comoving with its primary star. In our survey, these two detections correspond to {\~{}}4{\%} of solar-type stars having companions in the 6-20 M J mass and {\~{}}200-500 AU separation range. This figure is higher than would be expected if brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions were drawn from an extrapolation of the binary mass function. Finally, we discuss implications for the formation of these objects.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous clouds or temperature perturbations in rotating brown dwarfs produce variability in the observed flux. We report time-resolved simultaneous observations of the variable T6.5 brown dwarf 2MASS J22282889–431026 over the wavelength ranges 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m and broadband 4.5 $\mu$m. Spectroscopic observations were taken with Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope and photometry with the Spitzer Space Telescope . The object shows sinusoidal infrared variability with a period of 1.4 hr at most wavelengths with peak-to-peak amplitudes between 1.45{\%} and 5.3{\%} of the mean flux. While the light curve shapes are similar at all wavelengths, their phases differ from wavelength to wavelength with a maximum difference of more than half of a rotational period. We compare the spectra with atmospheric models of different cloud prescriptions, from which we determine the pressure levels probed at different wavelengths. We find that the phase lag increases with decreasing pressure level, or higher altitude. We discuss a number of plausible scenarios that could cause this trend of light curve phase with probed pressure level. These observations are the first to probe heterogeneity in an ultracool atmosphere in both horizontal and vertical directions, and thus are an ideal test case for realistic three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheric structure with clouds in brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets.},

abstract = {Many of the Kepler close binaries are suggested to constitute hierarchical triple systems through their eclipse timing variations (ETVs). Eclipses by the third body in those systems, if observed, provide precise constraints on its physical and orbital properties, which are otherwise difficult to obtain. In this Letter, we analyze such a "tertiary event" observed only once in the KIC 6543674 system. The system consists of a short-period ({\$}2.4\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}days{\}}{\$}) inner eclipsing binary and a third body on a wide ({\$}1100\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}days{\}}{\$}) and eccentric ({\$}e\backslashsimeq0.6{\$}) orbit. Analysis of three tertiary eclipses around a single inferior conjunction of the third body yields the mutual inclination between the inner and outer binary planes to be {\$}3.3{\^{}}\backslashcirc\backslashpm0.6{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}, indicating an extremely flat geometry. Furthermore, combining the timings and shapes of the tertiary eclipses with the phase curve and ETVs of the inner binary, we determine the mass and radius ratios of all three bodies in the system using the Kepler photometry alone. With the primary mass and temperature from the Kepler Input Catalog, the absolute masses, radii, and effective temperatures of the three stars are obtained as follows: {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}A{\}}=1.2\backslashpm0.3\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, {\$}R{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}A{\}}=1.8\backslashpm0.1\backslash,R{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}B{\}}=1.1{\_}{\{}-0.2{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.3{\}}\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, {\$}R{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}B{\}}=1.4\backslashpm0.1\backslash,R{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}=0.50{\_}{\{}-0.08{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.07{\}}\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, {\$}R{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}=0.50\backslashpm0.04\backslash,R{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, {\$}T{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}A{\}} \backslashsimeq T{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}B{\}}\backslashsimeq 6100\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}K{\}}{\$}, and {\$}T{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}C{\}}{\textless}5000\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}K{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {While brown dwarfs show similarities with stars in their early life, their spin evolution is much more akin to that of planets. We have used lightcurves from the K2 mission to measure new rotation periods for 18 young brown dwarfs in the Taurus star-forming region. Our sample spans masses from 0.02 to 0.08 Msol and has been characterised extensively in the past. To search for periods, we utilize three different methods (autocorrelation, periodogram, Gaussian Processes). The median period for brown dwarfs with disks is twice as long as for those without (3.1 vs. 1.6 d), a signature of rotational braking by the disk, albeit with small numbers. With an overall median period of 1.9 d, brown dwarfs in Taurus rotate slower than their counterparts in somewhat older (3-10 Myr) star-forming regions, consistent with spin-up of the latter due to contraction and angular momentum conservation, a clear sign that disk braking overall is inefficient and/or temporary in this mass domain. We confirm the presence of a linear increase of the typical rotation period as a function of mass in the sub-stellar regime. The rotational velocities, when calculated forward to the age of the solar system assuming angular momentum conservation, fit the known spin-mass relation for solar system planets and extra-solar planetary-mass objects. This spin-mass trend holds over six orders of magnitude in mass, including objects from several different formation paths. Our result implies that brown dwarfs by and large retain their primordial angular momentum through the first few Myr of their evolution.},

abstract = {Context. Recent observations indicate potentially carbon-rich (C/O{\textgreater}1) exoplanet atmospheres. Spectral fitting methods for brown dwarfs and exoplanets have invoked the C/O ratio as additional parameter but carbon-rich cloud formation modeling is a challenge for the models applied. The determination of the habitable zone for exoplanets requires the treatment of cloud formation in chemically different regimes. Aims. We aim to model cloud formation processes for carbon rich exoplanetary atmospheres. Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may emerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary evolution. Methods. We extend our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed formation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by gas-surface reactions. We solve a system of dust moment equations and element conservation for a pre-scribed Drift-Phoenix atmosphere structure to study how a cloud structure would change with changing initial C/O 0 =0.43 . . . 10.0. Results. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich atmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases due to carbon being a very effective growth species. The consequence is that less particles will make up a cloud for C/O 0 {\textgreater}1. The cloud particles will be smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. An increasing initial C/O ratio does not revert this trend because a much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a rich carbon environment. Cloud particles are generally made of a mix of materials: carbon dominates if C/O 0 {\textgreater}1 and silicates dominate if C/O 0 {\textless}1. 80-90{\%} carbon is reached only in extreme cases where C/O 0 =3.0 or 10.0. Conclusions. Carbon-rich atmospheres would form clouds that are made of particles of height-dependent mixed compositions, sizes and numbers. The remaining gas-phase is far less depleted than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Typical tracer molecules are HCN and C 2 H 2 in combination with a featureless, smooth continuum due to a carbonaceous cloud cover, unless the cloud particles become crystalline.},

abstract = {We present a new method to retrieve molecular abundances and temperature profiles from exoplanet atmosphere photometry and spectroscopy. We run millions of one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models in order to cover the large range of allowed parameter space. In order to run such a large number of models, we have developed a parametric pressure-temperature (P-T) profile coupled with line-by-line radiative transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy balance, along with prescriptions for non-equilibrium molecular composition and energy redistribution. The major difference from traditional 1D radiative transfer models is the parametric P-T profile, which essentially means adopting energy balance only at the top of the atmosphere and not in each layer. We see the parametric P-T model as a parallel approach to the traditional exoplanet atmosphere models that rely on several free parameters to encompass unknown absorbers and energy redistribution. The parametric P-T profile captures the basic physical features of temperature structures in planetary atmospheres (including temperature inversions), and fits a wide range of published P-T profiles, including those of solar system planets. We apply our temperature and abundance retrieval method to the atmospheres of two transiting exoplanets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b, which have the best Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope data available. For HD 189733b, we find efficient day-night redistribution of energy in the atmosphere, and molecular abundance constraints confirming the presence of H 2 O, CO, CH 4 , and CO 2. For HD 209458b, we confirm and constrain the dayside thermal inversion in an average 1D temperature profile. We also report independent detections of H 2 O, CO, CH 4 , and CO 2 on the dayside of HD 209458b, based on six-channel Spitzer photometry. We report constraints for HD 189733b due to individual data sets separately; a few key observations are variable in different data sets at similar wavelengths. Moreover, a noticeably strong CO 2 absorption in one data set is significantly weaker in another. We must, therefore, acknowledge the strong possibility that the atmosphere is variable, both in its energy redistribution state and in the chemical abundances.},

By comparing our new STIS images to those taken with STIS in 2000 and with NICMOS in 1998, 2004, and 2005, we demonstrate that TW Hya's azimuthal surface brightness asymmetry moves coherently in position angle.

Further monitoring of this and other shadows on protoplanetary disks potentially opens a new avenue for indirectly observing the sites of planet formation.},

abstract = {Context. Current planet formation models are largely based on the observational constraint that protoplanetary disks have a lifetime of {\~{}}3 Myr. Recent studies, however, report the existence of pre-main-sequence stars with signatures of accretion (strictly connected with the presence of circumstellar disks) and photometrically determined ages of 30 Myr or more. Aims: Here, we present a spectroscopic study of two major age outliers in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We use broadband, intermediate resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra combined with an accurate method to determine the stellar parameters and the related age of the targets to confirm their peculiar age estimates and the presence of ongoing accretion. Methods: The analysis is based on a multicomponent fitting technique, which derives simultaneously spectral type, extinction, and accretion properties of the objects. With this method, we confirm and quantify the ongoing accretion. From the photospheric parameters of the stars, we derive their position on the H-R diagram and the age given by evolutionary models. With other age indicators like the lithium-equivalent width, we estimate the age of the objects with high accuracy. Results: Our study shows that the two objects analyzed are not older than the typical population of the Orion Nebula Cluster. While photometric determination of the photospheric parameters are an accurate method to estimate the parameters of the bulk of young stellar populations, our results show that those of individual objects with high accretion rates and extinction may be affected by large uncertainties. Broadband spectroscopic determinations should thus be used to confirm the nature of individual objects. Conclusions: The analysis carried out shows that this method allows us to obtain an accurate determination of the photospheric parameters of accreting young stellar objects in any nearby star-forming region. We suggest that our detailed, broadband spectroscopy method should be used to derive accurate properties of candidate old and accreting young stellar objects in star-forming regions. We also discuss how a similarly accurate determination of stellar properties can be obtained through a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data.

The new GPI data complement recent HST/STIS observations that show the disk extending out to over 500{\~{}}AU. The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along the projected minor axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected major axis. We associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized forward scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To constrain the disk geometry we fit two separate disk models to the polarized image, each using a different scattering phase function. Both models favor a disk inclination of {\$}\backslashsim 70\backslashdegr{\$} and a {\$}1.5\backslashpm0.6{\$} AU stellar offset in the plane of the sky along the projected major axis of the disk. We find that the stellar offset in the disk plane, perpendicular to the projected major axis is degenerate with the form of the scattering phase function and remains poorly constrained. The disk is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong adaptive optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the system's proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources' positions relative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are background objects and unrelated to the disk's offset from the star.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI) program that identifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition with deep neural nets---the PICS (Pulsar Image-based Classification System) AI. The AI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferences by looking for patterns from candidate. The information from each pulsar candidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up to thousands pixel of image data. The AI takes these data from each candidate as its input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its {\~{}}9000 neurons. Different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns, the PICS AI teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a set of human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The deep neural networks in this AI system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types of pulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has been validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set. In this completely independent test, PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related candidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1{\%}) of 90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. The first non-pulsar candidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. In other words, 100{\%} of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1{\%} of all candidates, while 80{\%} were ranked higher than any noise or interference. The performance of this system can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. This AI system has been integrated into the PALFA survey pipeline and has discovered six new pulsars to date.},

abstract = {Short-period planets exhibit day-night temperature contrasts of hundreds to thousands of degrees K. They also exhibit eastward hotspot offsets whereby the hottest region on the planet is east of the substellar point; this has been widely interpreted as advection of heat due to eastward winds. We present thermal phase observations of the hot Jupiter CoRoT-2b obtained with the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope. These measurements show the most robust detection to date of a westward hotspot offset of 23 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 4 degrees, in contrast with the nine other planets with equivalent measurements. The peculiar infrared flux map of CoRoT-2b may result from westward winds due to non-synchronous rotation magnetic effects, or partial cloud coverage, that obscures the emergent flux from the planet's eastern hemisphere. Non-synchronous rotation and magnetic effects may also explain the planet's anomalously large radius. On the other hand, partial cloud coverage could explain the featureless dayside emission spectrum of the planet. If CoRoT-2b is not tidally locked, then it means that our understanding of star-planet tidal interaction is incomplete. If the westward offset is due to magnetic effects, our result represents an opportunity to study an exoplanet's magnetic field. If it has Eastern clouds, then it means that our understanding of large-scale circulation on tidally locked planets is incomplete.},

abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR channel is extensively used in time-resolved observations, especially for transiting exoplanet spectroscopy and brown dwarf and directly imaged exoplanet rotational phase mapping. The ramp effect is the dominant source of systematics in the WFC3 for time-resolved observations, which limits its photometric precision. Current mitigation strategies are based on empirical fits and require additional orbits "to help the telescope reach a thermal equilibrium". We show that the ramp effect profiles can be explained and corrected with high fidelity using charge trapping theories. We also present a model for this process that can be used to predict and to correct charge trap systematics. Our model is based on a very small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the detector. We find that these parameters are very stable between the different datasets, and we provide best-fit values. Our model is tested with more than 120 orbits ({\$}\backslashsim40{\$} visits) of WFC3 observations and is proved to be able to provide near photon noise limited corrections for observations made with both staring and scanning modes of transiting exoplanets as well as for starting-mode observations of brown dwarfs. After our model correction, the light curve of the first orbit in each visit has the same photometric precision as subsequent orbits, so data from the first orbit need no longer be discarded. Near IR arrays with the same physical characteristics (e.g., JWST/NIRCam) may also benefit from the extension of this model, if similar systematic profiles are observed.},

However, it is apparent that much work remains to be done in the areas of material, diode passivation, and diode formation technologies before the " holy grail " of photon detection at room temperature for all infrared wavelengths is achieved. Over the years, at DRS, we have developed a technology base for both n-and p-type HgCdTe materials parameters that are relevant to photodiode design and fab-rication. This paper will discuss data that we have taken recently on minority carrier lifetime in MWIR and long wave infrared (LWIR) HgCdTe, particularly p type, and how it compares to current theories of Auger 7, radiative, and Shockley–Read recombination in this material. Extrinsic group IB (Cu, Au) and group V (arsenic) p-type dopants were used, together with group III (In) for n-type. The impact of the data on future HOT detector work is discussed.},

To efficiently search this unexplored space via visual inspection, we have launched a new citizen science project, called "Backyard Worlds: Planet 9," which asks volunteers to examine short animations composed of difference images constructed from time-resolved WISE coadds. We report the discovery of the first new substellar object found by this project, WISEA J110125.95+540052.8, a T5.5 brown dwarf located approximately 34 pc from the Sun with a total proper motion of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.7 as yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {WIRC+Pol is a newly commissioned low-resolution (R 100), near-infrared (J and H bands) spectropolarimetry mode of the Wide-field InfraRed Camera (WIRC) on the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. The instrument utilizes a novel polarimeter design based on a quarter-wave plate and a polarization grating (PG), which provides full linear polarization measurements (Stokes I, Q,  and U ) in one exposure with no need for  a polarimetric modulator. The PG also has high transmission across the J and H bands. The instrument is situated at the prime focus of an equatorially mounted telescope. As a result, the system only has one reflection in the light path and the instrument does not rotate with respect to the sky, which provides minimal and  stable telescope induced polarization. A data reduction pipeline has been developed for WIRC+Pol to produce linear polarization measurements from observations, allowing, e.g., real-time monitoring of the signal-to-noise ratio of ongoing observations. WIRC+Pol has been on-sky since February 2017. Results from the first year commissioning data show that the instrument has a high dispersion efficiency as expected from the polarization grating. We discuss instrumental systematics we have uncovered in the data, their potential causes, along with calibrations that are necessary to eliminate them. We demonstrate the polarimetric stability of the instrument with RMS variation at 0.2{\%} level over 30 minutes for a bright standard star (J = 8.7). While the spectral extraction is photon noise limited, polarization calibration between sources remain limited by systematics.},

abstract = {Using 3D global hydro simulations coupled with radiative transfer calculations, we study the appearance of density waves induced by giant planets in direct imaging observations at near infrared wavelengths. We find that a 6 MJ planet in a typical disk around a 1 M{\_}sun star can produce prominent and detectable spiral arms both interior and exterior to its orbit. The inner arms have (1) two well separated arms in roughly m=2 symmetry, (2) exhibit {\~{}}10-15 degrees pitch angles, (3) {\~{}}180-270 degrees extension in the azimuthal direction, and (4) {\~{}}150{\%} surface brightness enhancement, all broadly consistent with observed spiral arms in the SAO 206462 and MWC 758 systems. The outer arms cannot explain observations as they are too tightly wound given typical disk scale height. We confirm previous results that the outer density waves excited by a 1 MJ planet exhibit low contrast in the IR and are practically not detectable. We also find that 3D effects of the waves are important. Compared to isothermal models, density waves in adiabatic disks exhibit weaker contrast in surface density but stronger contrast in scattered light images, due to a more pronounced vertical structure in the former caused by shock heating. To drive observed pairs of arms with an external companion on a circular orbit, a massive planet, possibly a brown dwarf, is needed at around [r{\~{}}0.7", PA{\~{}}10 degrees] (position angle PA from north to east) in SAO 206462 and [r{\~{}}0.6 , PA{\~{}}10 degrees] in MWC 758.

abstract = {Rotational modulations of brown dwarfs have recently provided powerful constraints on the properties of ultra-cool atmospheres, including longitudinal and vertical cloud structures and cloud evolution. Furthermore, periodic light curves directly probe the rotational periods of ultra-cool objects. We present here, for the first time, time-resolved high-precision photometric measurements of a planetary-mass companion, 2M1207b. We observed the binary system with Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 in two bands and with two spacecraft roll angles. Using point-spread function-based photometry, we reach a nearly photon-noise limited accuracy for both the primary and the secondary. While the primary is consistent with a flat light curve, the secondary shows modulations that are clearly detected in the combined light curve as well as in different subsets of the data. The amplitudes are 1.36{\%} in the F125W and 0.78{\%} in the F160W filters, respectively. By fitting sine waves to the light curves, we find a consistent period of {\{}10.7{\}}-0.6+1.2 hr and similar phases in both bands. The J- and H-band amplitude ratio of 2M1207b is very similar to a field brown dwarf that has identical spectral type but different J-H color. Importantly, our study also measures, for the first time, the rotation period for a directly imaged extra-solar planetary-mass companion.},

In the Solar System, the equatorial rotation velocities and, consequently, spin angular momenta of most of the planets increase with planetary mass; the exceptions to this trend are Mercury and Venus, which, since formation, have significantly spun down because of tidal interactions. Here we report near-infrared spectroscopic observations, at a resolving power of 100,000, of the young extrasolar gas giant planet $\beta$ Pictoris b (refs 7, 8). The absorption signal from carbon monoxide in the planet's thermal spectrum is found to be blueshifted with respect to that from the parent star by approximately 15 kilometres per second, consistent with a circular orbit. The combined line profile exhibits a rotational broadening of about 25 kilometres per second, meaning that $\beta$ Pictoris b spins significantly faster than any planet in the Solar System, in line with the extrapolation of the known trend in spin velocity with planet mass.},

abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly beheved in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples.},

abstract = {The spin of a planet or brown dwarf is related to the accretion process, and therefore studying spin can help promote our understanding of the formation of such objects. We present the projected rotational velocity of the young sub-stellar companion GQ Lupi b, along with its barycentric radial velocity. The directly imaged exoplanet or brown dwarf companion joins a small but growing ensemble of wide-orbit sub-stellar companions with a spin measurement. The GQ Lupi system was observed at high spectral resolution (R {\~{}} 100000), and in the analysis we made use of both spectral and spatial filtering to separate the signal of the companion from that of the host star. We detect both CO (S/N=11.6) and H2O (S/N=7.7) in the atmosphere of GQ Lupi b by cross-correlating with model spectra, and we find it to be a slow rotator with a projected rotational velocity of {\$}5.3{\^{}}{\{}+0.9{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.0{\}}{\$} km/s. The slow rotation is most likely due to its young age of {\textless} 5 Myr, as it is still in the process of accreting material and angular momentum. We measure the barycentric radial velocity of GQ Lupi b to be {\$}2.0 \backslashpm 0.4{\$} km/s, and discuss the allowed orbital configurations and their implications for formation scenarios for GQ Lupi b.},

abstract = {In an atmosphere, a cloud condensation region is characterized by a strong vertical gradient in the abundance of the related condensing species. On Earth, the ensuing gradient of mean molecular weight has relatively few dynamical consequences because N{\$}{\_}2{\$} is heavier than water vapor, so that only the release of latent heat significantly impacts convection. On the contrary, in an hydrogen dominated atmosphere (e.g. giant planets), all condensing species are significantly heavier than the background gas. This can stabilize the atmosphere against convection near a cloud deck if the enrichment in the given species exceeds a critical threshold. This raises two questions. What is transporting energy in such a stabilized layer, and how affected can the thermal profile of giant planets be? To answer these questions, we first carry out a linear analysis of the convective and double-diffusive instabilities in a condensable medium showing that an efficient condensation can suppress double-diffusive convection. This suggests that a stable radiative layer can form near a cloud condensation level, leading to an increase in the temperature of the deep adiabat. Then, we investigate the impact of the condensation of the most abundant species---water---with a steady-state atmosphere model. Compared to standard models, the temperature increase can reach several hundred degrees at the quenching depth of key chemical tracers. Overall, this effect could have many implications for our understanding of the dynamical and chemical state of the atmosphere of giant planets, for their future observations (with Juno for example), and for their internal evolution.},

abstract = {High-contrast adaptive optics (AO) imaging is a powerful technique to probe the architectures of planetary systems from the outside-in and survey the atmospheres of self-luminous giant planets. Direct imaging has rapidly matured over the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of high-order AO systems, dedicated planet-finding instruments with specialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing strategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results, discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical overview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on observations of 384 unique and single young (≈5–300 Myr) stars spanning stellar masses between 0.1 and 3.0 M e , the overall occurrence rate of 5–13 M Jup companions at orbital distances of 30–300 au is -+ 0.6 {\%} 0.5 0.7 assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive giant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot Jupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual stellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically significant trend in planet frequency with host mass: giant planets are found around -+ 2.8 {\%} 2.3 3.7 of BA stars, {\textless}4.1{\%} of FGK stars, and {\textless}3.9{\%} of M dwarfs. Looking forward, extreme AO systems and the next generation of ground-and space-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection limits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics, composition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses and ages.},

abstract = {We present a high spatial resolution multiwavelength survey of 44 young binary star systems in Taurus-Auriga with separations of 10-1000 AU. These observations, which were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, quadruple the number of close (less than 100 AU) binary stars with spatially resolved measurements from 0.3 to 2.2 $\mu$m and are the first 3.6 $\mu$m measurements for the majority of the companion stars in the sample. Masses and ages are estimated for the components observed at optical wavelengths. The relative ages of binary star components are more similar than the relative ages of randomly paired single stars within the same star-forming region. This is the first statistically significant evidence for coeval formation. Only one of the companion masses is substellar, from which we conclude that the apparent overabundance of T Tauri star companions relative to main-sequence star companions is not due to a wealth of substellar secondaries that would have been missed in main-sequence surveys. The circumstellar environments of binary star systems are studied in this work through three diagnostics: the infrared color K-L, the ultraviolet excess $\Delta$U, and H$\alpha$ emission. Several conclusions are drawn. First, the mass accretion rates for primary stars are similar to single stars, which suggests that companions as close as 10 AU have little effect on the mass accretion rate. Second, although most classical T Tauri star binaries retain both a circumprimary and a circumsecondary disk, there are several systems with only a circumprimary disk. Systems with only a circumsecondary disk are rare. This suggests that circumprimary disks survive longer than circumsecondary disks. Third, primary stars accrete at a higher rate, on average, than secondary stars. This is most likely because of their larger stellar mass, since the mass accretion rates for both single and binary T Tauri stars exhibit a moderate mass dependence. Fourth, approximately 10{\%} of T Tauri binary star components have very red near-infrared colors (K-L{\textgreater}1.4) and unusually high mass accretion rates. This phenomenon does not appear to be restricted to binary systems, however, since a comparable fraction of single T Tauri stars exhibit the same properties. These high accretion rate stars are probably not at an earlier stage of evolution, as has been proposed. Their semblance of younger protostars at optical and infrared wavelengths is most likely because of their similar high levels of accretion, which are above the norm for T Tauri stars, and not because of similar ages. The stellar and circumstellar properties are also used to trace indirectly the evolution of circumbinary material. In contrast to single T Tauri stars, which have disk dissipation timescales comparable to their ages, the disk dissipation timescales for binary T Tauri stars are {\~{}}10 times less than their ages. Replenishment of the inner circumstellar disks may be necessary to explain the continuing disk accretion in these systems. The longer disk lifetimes of circumprimary disks, despite their higher depletion rates, suggest that circumprimary disks are being preferentially replenished, possibly from a circumbinary reservoir with low angular momentum relative to the binary. Further support for circumbinary reservoirs comes from the observed correlated presence of circumprimary and circumsecondary disks for binaries with separations of less than {\~{}}200 AU. The presence of disks appears uncorrelated for wider binaries. Additionally, binaries with separations of less than {\~{}}100 AU exhibit a higher fraction of high mass ratio (ms/mp) pairs than wider binaries. These separation-dependent properties can be explained if the components are being replenished from a common circumbinary reservoir with low angular momentum. The components of the closest pairs are expected to be more equally replenished than the widest pairs, which consequently sustains both disks and drives their mass ratios toward unity. Overall, the results of this study corroborate previous work that suggests that fragmentation is the dominant binary star formation mechanism in Taurus-Auriga disk instabilities and capture seem unlikely.},

abstract = {There is a striking and unexplained dearth of brown dwarf companions in close orbits ({\textless}3 AU) around stars more massive than the Sun, in stark contrast to the frequency of stellar and planetary companions. Although rare and relatively short-lived, these systems leave detectable evolutionary end points in the form of white-dwarf-brown-dwarf binaries and these remnants can offer unique insights into the births and deaths of their parent systems. We present the discovery of a close (orbital separation ∼0.006 AU) substellar companion to a massive white dwarf member of the Praesepe star cluster. Using the cluster age and the mass of the white dwarf, we constrain the mass of the white dwarf progenitor star to lie in the range 3.5-3.7 M (B9). The high mass of the white dwarf means the substellar companion must have been engulfed by the B star's envelope while it was on the late asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Hence, the initial separation of the system was ∼2 AU, with common envelope evolution reducing the separation to its current value. The initial and final orbital separations allow us to constrain the combination of the common envelope efficiency ($\alpha$) and binding energy parameters ($\lambda$) for the AGB star to $\alpha$$\lambda$ ∼ 3. We examine the various formation scenarios and conclude that the substellar object was most likely captured by the white dwarf progenitor early in the life of the cluster, rather than forming in situ.},

The basis of the spectral extraction within aXe are the position, morphology and photometry of the objects on a companion direct image. Several aspects of slitless spectroscopy, such as the overlap of spectra, an extraction dependent on object shape and the provision of flat-field cubes, motivate a dedicated software package, and the solutions offered within aXe are discussed in detail. The effect of the mutual contamination of spectra can be quantitatively assessed in aXe, using spectral and morphological information from the companion direct image(s). A new method named 'aXedrizzle' for 2D rebinning and co-adding spectral data, taken with small shifts or dithers, is described. The extraction of slitless spectra with optimal weighting is outlined and the correction of spectra for detector fringing for the ACS CCD's is presented.

abstract = {The cause of hot Jupiter radius inflation, where giant planets with {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eq{\}}{\$} {\$}{\textgreater}1000{\$} K are significantly larger than expected, is an open question and the subject of many proposed explanations. Rather than examine these models individually, this work seeks to characterize the anomalous heating as a function of incident flux, {\$}\backslashepsilon(F){\$}, needed to inflate the population of planets to their observed sizes. We then compare that result to theoretical predictions for various models. We examine the population of about 300 giant planets with well-determined masses and radii and apply thermal evolution and Bayesian statistical models to infer the anomalous power as a function of incident flux that best reproduces the observed radii. First, we observe that the inflation of planets below about {\$}M=0.5 \backslash;\backslashrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashrm{\{}J{\}}{\$} appears very different than their higher mass counterparts, perhaps as the result of mass loss or an inefficient heating mechanism. As such, we exclude planets below this threshold. Next, we show with strong significance that {\$}\backslashepsilon(F){\$} increases with {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}eq{\}}{\}}{\$} towards a maximum of {\$}\backslashsim 2.5\backslash{\%}{\$} at {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}eq{\}}{\}} \backslashapprox 1500{\$} K, and then decreases as temperatures increase further, falling to {\$}\backslashsim0.2\backslash{\%}{\$} at {\$}T{\_}\backslashrm{\{}eff{\}}= 2500{\$} K. This high-flux decrease in inflation efficiency was predicted by the Ohmic dissipation model of giant planet inflation but not other models. We also explicitly check the thermal tides model and find that it predicts far more variance in radii than is observed. Thus, our results provide evidence for the Ohmic dissipation model and a functional form for {\$}\backslashepsilon(F){\$} that any future theories of hot Jupiter radii can be tested against.},

abstract = {We summarize observational results on the stellar population and star formation history of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association (Sco OB2), the nearest region of recent massive star formation.  It consists of three subgroups, Upper Scorpius (US), Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL), and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC) which have ages of about 5, 17, and 16 Myr. While the high- and intermediate mass association members have been studied for several decades, the low-mass population remained mainly unexplored until rather recently.  In Upper Scorpius, numerous studies, in particular large multi-object spectroscopic surveys, have recently revealed hundreds of low-mass association members, including dozens of brown dwarfs.  The investigation of a large representative sample of association members provided detailed information about the stellar population and the star formation history.  The empirical mass function could be established over the full stellar mass range from 0.1 M{\_}⊙ up to 20 M{\_}⊙, and was found to be consistent with recent determinations of the field initial mass function.  A narrow range of ages around 5 Myr was found for the low-mass stars, the same age as had previously (and independently) been derived for the high-mass members.  This supports earlier indications that the star formation process in US was triggered, and agrees with previous conjectures that the triggering event was a supernova- and wind-driven shock-wave originating from the nearby UCL group.  In the older UCL and LCC regions, large numbers of low-mass members have recently been identified among X-ray and proper-motion selected candidates.  In both subgroups, low-mass members have also been serendipitously discovered through investigations of X-ray sources in the vicinity of better known regions (primarily the Lupus and TW Hya associations). While both subgroups appear to have mean ages of ˜16 Myr, they both show signs of having substructure. Their star-formation histories may be more complex than that of the younger, more compact US group.  Sco-Cen is an important ``astrophysics laboratory'' for detailed studies of recently formed stars. For example, the ages of the sub-groups of 5 Myr and ˜ 16 Myr are ideal for studying how circumstellar disks evolve.  While no more than a few percent of the Sco-Cen members appear to be accreting from a circumstellar disk, recent Spitzer results suggest that at least ˜35{\%} still have cold, dusty, debris disks.},

The aggregate dayside emission spectrum of these planets exhibits no molecular features, nor is brightness temperature greater in the near-infrared. We combine brightness temperatures at various infrared wavelengths to estimate the dayside effective temperature of each planet. We find that dayside temperatures are proportional to irradiation temperatures, indicating modest Bond albedo and no internal energy sources, plus weak evidence that dayside temperatures of the hottest planets are disproportionately high. We place joint constraints on Bond albedo, {\$}A{\_}{\{}B{\}}{\$}, and day-to-night transport efficiency, {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$}, for six planets by combining thermal eclipse and phase variation measurements (HD 149026b, HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-18b, and WASP-43b). We confirm that planets with high irradiation temperatures have low heat transport efficiency, and that WASP-43b has inexplicably poor transport; these results are statistically significant even if the precision of single-eclipse measurements has been overstated by a factor of three. Lastly, we attempt to break the {\$}A{\_}{\{}B{\}}{\$}-{\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$} degeneracy for nine planets with both thermal and optical eclipse observations, but no thermal phase measurements.

Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed atmospheric study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H2O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the transmission spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b's atmospheric heavy element content (Embedded Image times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b's atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich planetesimals.},

abstract = {Prior to the 1990s, speculations about the occurrence of planets around other stars were based only on planet formation theory, observations of circumstellar disks, and the knowledge that at least one seemingly ordinary star had managed to make a variety of different planets. Since then, Doppler and transit surveys have revealed the population of planets around other Sun-like stars, especially those with orbital periods shorter than a few years. Over the last decade these surveys have risen to new heights with Doppler spectrographs capable of 1 m/s precision, and space telescopes capable of detecting the transits of Earth-sized planets. This article is a brief introductory review of the knowledge of planet occurrence that has been gained from these surveys.},

abstract = {Three Earth-sized exoplanets were recently discovered close to the habitable zone of the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 (ref. 3). The nature of these planets has yet to be determined, as their masses remain unmeasured and no observational constraint is available for the planetary population surrounding ultracool dwarfs, of which the TRAPPIST-1 planets are the first transiting example. Theoretical predictions span the entire atmospheric range, from depleted to extended hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Here we report observations of the combined transmission spectrum of the two inner planets during their simultaneous transits on 4 May 2016. The lack of features in the combined spectrum rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for each planet at ≥10$\sigma$ levels; TRAPPIST-1 b and c are therefore unlikely to have an extended gas envelope as they occupy a region of parameter space in which high-altitude cloud/haze formation is not expected to be significant for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Many denser atmospheres remain consistent with the featureless transmission spectrum-from a cloud-free water-vapour atmosphere to a Venus-like one.},

An analytic relationship among the gap depth, planet mass {\$}M{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\$}, disk aspect ratio {\$}h{\_}p{\$}, and viscosity {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} has been found recently, and the gap depth can be written in terms of a single parameter {\$}K= (M{\_}{\{}p{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}){\^{}}2 h{\_}p{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} \backslashalpha{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. We discuss how observed gap features can be used to constrain the disk and/or planet parameters based on the analytic formula for the gap depth. The constraint on the disk aspect ratio is critical in determining the planet mass so the combination of the observations of the temperature and the image can provide a constraint on the planet mass. We apply the formula for the gap depth to observations of HL{\~{}}Tau and HD{\~{}}169142. In the case of HL{\~{}}Tau, we propose that a planet with {\$}\backslashgtrsim 0.3{\$} is responsible for the observed gap at {\$}30{\$}{\~{}}AU from the central star based on the estimate that the gap depth is {\$}\backslashlesssim 1/3{\$}. In the case of HD{\~{}}169142, the planet mass that causes the gap structure recently found by VLA is {\$}\backslashgtrsim 0.4 M{\_}J{\$}. We also argue that the spiral structure, if observed, can be used to estimate the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio and the planet mass.},

Keck II 10 meter telescope between 2009 and 2014. In addition, we present updated astrometry from previously published observations in 2007 and 2008. All data were reduced using the SOSIE algorithm, which accounts for systematic biases present in previously published observations. This allows us to construct a self-consistent data set derived entirely from NIRC2 data alone. From this dataset, we detect acceleration for two of the planets (HR 8799b and e) at {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}. We also assess possible orbital parameters for each of the four planets independently. We find no statistically significant difference in the allowed inclinations of the planets. Fitting the astrometry while forcing coplanarity also returns {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} consistent to within 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} of the best fit values, suggesting that if inclination offsets of {\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}20{\$}{\^{}}{\{}o{\}}{\$} are present, they are not detectable with current data.

abstract = {Time-resolved photometry is an important new probe of the physics of condensate clouds in extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Extreme adaptive optics systems can directly image planets, but precise brightness measurements are challenging. We present VLT/SPHERE high-contrast, time-resolved broad H-band near-infrared photometry for four exoplanets in the HR 8799 system, sampling changes from night to night over five nights with relatively short integrations. The photospheres of these four planets are often modeled by patchy clouds and may show large-amplitude rotational brightness modulations. Our observations provide high-quality images of the system. We present a detailed performance analysis of different data analysis approaches to accurately measure the relative brightnesses of the four exoplanets. We explore the information in satellite spots and demonstrate their use as a proxy for image quality. While the brightness variations of the satellite spots are strongly correlated, we also identify a second-order anti-correlation pattern between the different spots. Our study finds that KLIP reduction basedon principal components analysis with satellite-spot-modulated artificial-planet-injection-based photometry leads to a significant (∼3×) gain in photometric accuracy over standard aperture-based photometry and reaches 0.1 mag per point accuracy for our data set, the signal-to-noise ratio of which is limited by small field rotation. Relative planet-to-planet photometry can be compared between nights, enabling observations spanning multiple nights to probe variability. Recent high-quality relative H-band photometry of the b–c planet pair agrees to about 1{\%}.},

We examine the detectability of radio auroral emission from Proxima b, the closest known exosolar planet orbiting our nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri. Using the Radiometric Bode's Law, we estimate the radio flux produced by the interaction of Proxima Centauri's stellar wind and Proxima b's magnetosphere for different planetary magnetic field strengths. For plausible planetary masses, Proxima b produces 6-83 mJy of auroral radio flux at frequencies of 0.3-0.8 MHz for planetary magnetic field strengths of 1-3 B{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$}. According to recent MHD models that vary the orbital parameters of the system, this emission is expected to be highly variable. This variability is due to large fluctuations in the size of Proxima b's magnetosphere as it crosses the equatorial streamer regions of the dense stellar wind and high dynamic pressure. Using the MHD model of Garraffo et al. 2016 for the variation of the magnetosphere radius during the orbit, we estimate that the observed radio flux can vary nearly by an order of magnitude over the 11.2 day period of Proxima b. The detailed amplitude variation depends on the stellar wind, orbital, and planetary magnetic field parameters. We discuss observing strategies for proposed future space-based observatories to reach frequencies below the ionospheric cut off ({\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} MHz) as would be required to detect the signal we investigate.},

abstract = {Hi-resolution spectroscopy (R {\textgreater} 25,000) has recently emerged as one of the leading methods to detect atomic and molecular species in the atmospheres of exoplanets. However, it has so far been lacking in a robust method to extract quantitative constraints on temperature structure and molecular/atomic abundances. In this work we present a novel Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework applicable to high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) that relies upon the cross-correlation between data and models to extract the planetary spectral signal. We successfully test the framework on simulated data and show that it can correctly determine Bayesian credibility intervals on atmospheric temperatures and abundances allowing for a quantitative exploration of the inherent degeneracies. Furthermore, our new framework permits us to trivially combine and explore the synergies between HRCCS and low-resolution spectroscopy (LRS) to provide maximal leverage on the information contained within each. This framework also allows us to quantitatively assess the impact of molecular line opacities at high resolution. We apply the framework to VLT CRIRES K-band spectra of HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b and retrieve abundant carbon monoxide but sub-solar abundances for water, largely invariant under different model assumptions. This confirms previous analysis of these datasets, but is possibly at odds with detections of water at different wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The framework presented here is the first step towards a true synergy between space observatories and ground-based hi-resolution observations.},

abstract = {Stimulated by the discovery of a number of close-in low-density planets, we generalise the Jeans escape parameter taking hydrody-namic and Roche lobe effects into account. We furthermore define $\Lambda$ as the value of the Jeans escape parameter calculated at the observed planetary radius and mass for the planet's equilibrium temperature and considering atomic hydrogen, independently of the atmospheric temperature profile. We consider 5 and 10 M ⊕ planets with an equilibrium temperature of 500 and 1000 K, orbiting early G-, K-, and M-type stars. Assuming a clear atmosphere and by comparing escape rates obtained from the energy-limited for-mula, which only accounts for the heating induced by the absorption of the high-energy stellar radiation, and from a hydrodynamic atmosphere code, which also accounts for the bolometric heating, we find that planets whose $\Lambda$ is smaller than 15–35 lie in the " boil-off " regime, where the escape is driven by the atmospheric thermal energy and low planetary gravity. We find that the atmosphere of hot (i.e. T eq 1000 K) low-mass (M pl 5 M ⊕) planets with $\Lambda$ {\textless} 15–35 shrinks to smaller radii so that their $\Lambda$ evolves to values higher than 15–35, hence out of the boil-off regime, in less than ≈500 Myr. Because of their small Roche lobe radius, we find the same result also for hot (i.e. T eq 1000 K) higher mass (M pl 10 M ⊕) planets with $\Lambda$ {\textless} 15–35, when they orbit M-dwarfs. For old, hydrogen-dominated planets in this range of parameters, $\Lambda$ should therefore be ≥15–35, which provides a strong constraint on the planetary minimum mass and maximum radius and can be used to predict the presence of aerosols and/or constrain planetary masses, for example.},

We then explore the possible formation mechanism for this object. We show that the standard planet formation mechanism of core accretion is far too slow to form this object within 10 Myr, the observed age of the system.

abstract = {Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring of stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics, providing access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases of stellar evolution and facilitating the quantitative study of planetary systems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the orbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious challenge, however, especially for extreme flux ratio systems and observations with relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes define sampling distributions of flexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for modeling stellar spectra, enabling proficient search for companion lines in time-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling, where the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic, rest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to invoke cross-correlation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this technique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M dwarf binary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared to traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the primary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other stellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to time-variable spectra. The code used in this analysis is freely available as an open source Python package.},

This expression is valid over the full composition range and for temperatures from 4.2 to 300 K.

PACS numbers: 71.25.Pi, 71.25.Tn The development of mercury-cadmium telluride in-frared detectors requires an accurate expression relating the energy band gap (Eg) to the mole fraction of cadmium (x) and temperature (T). Several such expressions have been present-ed in the literature, 1-5 each for a restricted range of x and T. In this work we present a new empirical expression for Eg(x,T) which has been fitted to energy gap data from a variety of sources covering the ranges O';;;x S 0.6 (plus x = 1) and 4.2 S T{\$} 300 K. The data used in the fitting of this expression were ob-tained from both optical absorption 1-3.6 and magneto-opti-cal experiments. 4. 7-20 The results of Ref. 6 are given in Table I. The studies used various methods to determine x. Fink-man and Nemirovsky3 estimated a value for the energy gap from the a = 1000 cm -1 point on optical transmission curves. They used x as stated by the vendor Cominco. Co-minco, in tum, determined x by optical transmission cutoff calibrated against the destructive chemistry of Hg 1 {\_} x Cd x Te wafers. Scott 2 defined Eg as the a = 500 cm -t point on optical transmission curves, and determined the composition from the density assuming a linear relation-ship. Schmidt and Stelzer 1 determined Eg from the detector cutoff at half-peak value. The detectors were 10 f.lm thick; thus, the peak response is equivalent to a = 1000 em -I and the half-peak value should approximate the a = 500 cm -t},

abstract = {Using results and calibrations from a previous paper (Gullbring et al. 1997), we estimate disk accretion rates for pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus and Chamaeleon I molecular cloud complexes. The median accretion rate for T Tauri stars of age {\~{}}1 Myr is {\~{}}10-8 M⊙  yr-1; the intrinsic scatter at a given age may be as large as 1  order of magnitude. There is a clear decline of mass accretion rates  M⊙ with increasing age t among T Tauri stars. Representing this  decline as M⊙ {\~{}}t-$\eta$, we estimate 1.5 ≲ $\eta$ ≲ 2.8; the large uncertainty is due to the wide range of accretion rates  at a given age, the limited age range of the sample, and errors in estimating  stellar ages and accretion luminosities. Adopting values of eta near the low  end of this range, which are more likely given probable errors and the neglect  of birthline age corrections, masses accreted during the T Tauri phase are roughly consistent with disk masses estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission. Similarity solutions for evolving, expanding disks are used to investigate observational constraints on disk properties employing a minimum of parameters. For an assumed power-law form of the disk viscosity with radius $\nu$ ∼ R$\gamma$, $\eta$≳ 1.5 corresponds to  $\gamma$ ≳ 1. The limit $\gamma$ ∼ 1 corresponds to a roughly  constant "$\alpha$" in the Shakura-Sunyaev (1973) viscosity parameterization;  using current observed disk sizes, we estimate $\alpha$ ∼ 10-2  (on scales ∼10-100 AU).  Much of the observed variation in mass accretion  rates can be accounted for by varying initial disk masses between 0.01 and 0.2  M⊙, but this result may be strongly affected by the presence of binary  companion stars. These results emphasize the need for older samples of stars  for studying disk evolution.},

For four brown dwarfs, we also obtained simulataneous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 G141 grism spectra during two epochs and derived light curves in five narrowband filters. Probing different pressure levels in the atmospheres, the multiwavelength light curves of our six targets all exhibit variations, and the shape of the light curves evolves over the timescale of a rotation period, ranging from 1.4 to 13 hr. We compare the shapes of the light curves and estimate the phase shifts between the light curves observed at different wavelengths by comparing the phase of the primary Fourier components. We use state-of-the-art atmosphere models to determine the flux contribution of different pressure layers to the observed flux in each filter. We find that the light curves that probe higher pressures are similar and in phase, but are offset and often different from the light curves that probe lower pressures. The phase differences between the two groups of light curves suggest that the modulations seen at lower and higher pressures may be introduced by different cloud layers.},

@article{Rosenblum2011,
abstract = {Double-diffusive convection, often referred to as semi-convection in astrophysics, occurs in thermally and compositionally stratified systems which are stable according to the Ledoux criterion but unstable according to the Schwarzschild criterion. This process has been given relatively little attention so far, and its properties remain poorly constrained. In this paper, we present and analyze a set of three-dimensional simulations of this phenomenon in a Cartesian domain under the Boussinesq approximation. We find that in some cases the double-diffusive convection saturates into a state of homogeneous turbulence, but with turbulent fluxes several orders of magnitude smaller than those expected from direct overturning convection. In other cases, the system rapidly and spontaneously develops closely packed thermo-compositional layers, which later successively merge until a single layer is left. We compare the output of our simulations with an existing theory of layer formation in the oceanographic context and find very good agreement between the model and our results. The thermal and compositional mixing rates increase significantly during layer formation and increase even further with each merger. We find that the heat flux through the staircase is a simple function of the layer height. We conclude by proposing a new approach to studying transport by double-diffusive convection in astrophysics.},

Additionally, we provide the mathematical formulation to convert synthetic equivalent widths to CCF parameters as an alternative to direct calibration. We have made our tool publicly available.},

abstract = {The reported investigation provides the strongest evidence now available for the existence of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation has been predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity, according to which an accelerating mass should radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves. Yet in cases of their suspected emission, the waves would be so weak, that they could not be detected. The binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 represents an object suitable for testing the prediction regarding gravitational radiation. In the absence of possibilities for a direct detection of the gravitational waves, possibilities exist for an indirect detection. An emission of gravitational radiation should lead to a gradual reduction in the orbital energy, causing the orbital period to decrease. It was found that the rate of decrease in the orbital period is proceeding at almost precisely the rate predicted by general relativity. The rate of decrease is not consistent with the predictions of other gravitational theories.},

For most of the Jupiters in our sample, we find the detectability of their atmospheres to be dependent on the planetary radius but not on the planetary mass. This indicates that planetary gravity plays a secondary role in the state of gaseous planetary atmospheres. We detect the presence of water vapour in all of the statistically detectable atmospheres, and we cannot rule out its presence in the atmospheres of the others. In addition, TiO and/or VO signatures are detected with 4{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence in WASP-76 b, and they are most likely present in WASP-121 b. We find no correlation between expected signal-to-noise and atmospheric detectability for most targets. This has important implications for future large-scale surveys.},

abstract = {The evolution and escape of the martian atmosphere and the planet's water inventory can be separated into an early and late evolutionary epoch. The first epoch started from the planet's origin and lasted {\$}\backslashsim{\$}500 Myr. Because of the high EUV flux of the young Sun and Mars' low gravity it was accompanied by hydrodynamic blow-off of hydrogen and strong thermal escape rates of dragged heavier species such as O and C atoms. After the main part of the protoatmosphere was lost, impact-related volatiles and mantle outgassing may have resulted in accumulation of a secondary CO{\$}{\_}2{\$} atmosphere of a few tens to a few hundred mbar around {\$}\backslashsim{\$}4--4.3 Gyr ago. The evolution of the atmospheric surface pressure and water inventory of such a secondary atmosphere during the second epoch which lasted from the end of the Noachian until today was most likely determined by a complex interplay of various nonthermal atmospheric escape processes, impacts, carbonate precipitation, and serpentinization during the Hesperian and Amazonian epochs which led to the present day surface pressure.},

abstract = {Interpretations of exoplanetary transmission spectra have been undermined by apparent ob-scuration due to clouds/hazes. Debate rages on whether weak H 2 O features seen in exoplanet spectra are due to clouds or inherently depleted oxygen. Assertions of solar H 2 O abundances have relied on making a priori model assumptions, for example, chemical/radiative equilibrium. In this work, we attempt to address this problem with a new retrieval paradigm for transmission spectra. We introduce POSEIDON, a two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval algorithm including generalized inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this prescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and prominent molecular abundances. We apply POSEIDON to the best transmission spectrum presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, uncovering new insights into its atmosphere at the day-night terminator. We extensively explore the parameter space with an unprecedented 10 8 models, spanning the continuum from fully cloudy to cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully Bayesian retrieval framework. We report the first detection of nitrogen chemistry (NH 3 and/or HCN) in an exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7-7.7$\sigma$ confidence, non-uniform cloud coverage at 4.5-5.4$\sigma$ , high-altitude hazes at {\textgreater}3$\sigma$ and sub-solar H 2 O at 3-5$\sigma$ , depending on the assumed cloud distribution. We detect NH 3 at 3.3$\sigma$ , and 4.9$\sigma$ for fully cloudy and cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model with the highest Bayesian evidence, we constrain H 2 O at 5-15 ppm (0.01-0.03) × solar and NH 3 at 0.01-2.7 ppm, strongly suggesting disequilibrium chemistry and cautioning against equilibrium assumptions. Our results herald a new promise for retrieving cloudy atmospheres using high-precision Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope spectra.},

abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanetary systems is a powerful technique that can reveal Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits, can enable detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres, and is a key step toward imaging Earth-like planets. Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our solar system.},

abstract = {Most models of volatile delivery to accreting terrestrial planets assume that the carriers for water are similar in water content to the carbonaceous chondrites in our Solar System. Here we suggest that the water content of primitive bodies in many planetary systems may actually be much higher, as carbonaceous chondrites have lost some of their original water due to heating from short-lived radioisotopes that drove parent body alteration. Using N-body simulations, we explore how planetary accretion would be different if bodies beyond the water line contained a water mass fraction consistent with chemical equilibrium calculations, and more similar to comets, as opposed to the more traditional water-depleted values. We apply this model to consider planet formation around stars of different masses and identify trends in the properties of Habitable Zone planets and planetary system architecture which could be tested by ongoing exoplanet census data collection. Comparison of such data with the model predicted trends will serve to evaluate how well the N-body simulations and the initial conditions used in studies of planetary accretion can be used to understand this stage of planet formation.},

abstract = {We here develop an improvedway of using a rotating star as a clock, set it using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps timewell. This technique, called gyrochronology, derives ages for low-massmain-sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is developed here and used to derive ages for illustrative groups of nearby field starswithmeasured rotation periods.We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extend it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars.We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on.We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ?15{\%} (plus possible systematic errors) for late F,G,K, and earlyMstars.Gyro ages for theMountWilson stars are shown to be in good agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the activemain-sequence field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators. These are shown to have amedian age of 365Myr. The sample of single field stars assembled by Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed and shown to have gyro ages ranging from under 100 Myr to several Gyr, with a median age of 1.2 Gyr. Finally, we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries ? Boo AB, 61 Cyg AB, and ? Cen AB yield substantially the same gyro ages},

This approach is critical for method validation and optimising observing strategies. In this paper we describe the implementation of Wayne for WFC3 in the near-infrared channel with the G102 and G141 grisms.

We analyze radial velocity data of $\tau$ Ceti and find robust evidence for wavelength dependent noise. We find this noise can be modeled by a combination of moving average models and " differential radial velocities " . We apply this noise model to various radial velocity data sets for $\tau$ Ceti, and find four periodic signals at 20.0, 49.3, 160 and 642 d which we interpret as planets. We identify two new signals with orbital periods of 20.0 and 49.3 d while the other two previously suspected signals around 160 and 600 d are quantified to a higher precision. The 20.0 d candidate is independently detected in KECK data. All planets detected in this work have minimum masses less than 4M ⊕ with the two long period ones located around the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone, respectively. We find that the instrumental noise gives rise to a precision limit of the HARPS around 0.2 m/s. We also find correlation between the HARPS data and the central moments of the spectral line profile at around 0.5 m/s level, although these central moments may contain both noise and signals. The signals detected in this work have semi-amplitudes as low as 0.3 m/s, demonstrating the ability of the radial velocity technique to detect relatively weak signals.},

We used high-resolution (R{\~{}}100,000), 3.2 micron spectra taken with CRIRES/VLT to trace the radial-velocity shift of the water features in the planet's dayside atmosphere during 4 hours of its 4.23-day orbit after superior conjunction. We detect the signature of molecular absorption by water at a significance of 5.6 sigma at a systemic velocity of Vsys=-33+/-2 km/s, coincident with the host star, with a corresponding orbital velocity Kp = 133{\^{}}+4.3{\_}-3.5 km/s. This translates directly to a planet mass of Mp=0.476{\^{}}+0.032{\_}-0.031MJ, placing it at the transition boundary between Jovian and Neptunian worlds. We determine upper and lower limits on the orbital inclination of the system of 70{\textless}i (deg){\textless}82.2. We also provide an updated orbital solution for 51 Peg b, using an extensive set of 639 stellar radial velocities measured between 1994 and 2013, finding no significant evidence of an eccentric orbit. We find no evidence of significant absorption or emission from other major carbon-bearing molecules of the planet, including methane and carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is non-inverted in the temperature-pressure region probed by these observations. The deepest absorption lines reach an observed relative contrast of 0.9x10{\^{}}-3 with respect to the host star continuum flux, at an angular separation of 3 milliarcseconds.

abstract = {Abstract Over the past five years, direct imaging surveys for extrasolar planets have discovered a small but significant number of planetary-mass companions at separations {\textgreater}50 AU from their host stars. These wide companions pose a significant challenge to models of planet formation and of substellar atmospheres and evolution, and there are still many puzzling questions regarding their formation and fundamental properties. To address these open topics, we propose a WFC3 optical imaging survey for 25 orbits to study 12 planetary-mass companions. Our survey has three goals: 1) to use UBV and narrowband Halpha photometry to determine if (and how much) these companions are accreting out of circumplanetary disks, 2) to use broadband optical photometry to measure their temperatures and luminosities by estimating their optical spectral types, and 3) to exploit the stable HST PSF to test whether any of the companions are marginally resolved binary pairs. None of these goals can be pursued from the ground, where high-resolution observing techniques are limited to near-infrared wavelengths and yield less stable PSFs},

abstract = {The magnetorotational instability (MRI) drives vigorous turbulence in a region of protoplanetary disks where the ionization fraction is sufficiently high. It has recently been shown that the electric field induced by the MRI can heat up electrons and thereby affect the ionization balance in the gas. In particular, in a disk where abundant dust grains are present, the electron heating causes a reduction of the electron abundance, thereby preventing further growth of the MRI. By using the nonlinear Ohm's law that takes into account electron heating, we investigate where in protoplanetary disks this negative feedback between the MRI and ionization chemistry becomes important. We find that the "e-heating zone," the region where the electron heating limits the saturation of the MRI, extends out to 80 AU in the minimum-mass solar nebula with abundant submicron-sized grains. This region is considerably larger than the conventional dead zone whose radial extent is {\$}\backslashsim20{\$} AU in the same disk model. Our simple estimate based on the scaling between the Maxwell stress and current density shows that that the MRI turbulence in the e-heating zone should have a significantly low saturation level, with the viscosity parameter {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} being from {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} to {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} at the midplane. This implies that the MRI should be "virtually dead" deep inside the e-heating zone. We also find that (sub)micron-sized grains in the e-heating zone are so negatively charged that their collisional growth is unlikely to occur.},

abstract = {Space missions such as Kepler, and soon TESS, provide large datasets that need to be analyzed efficiently and systematically in order to yield accurate exoplanet statistics. Recent work by Shallue {\&} Vanderburg (2018) demonstrated the successful application of state-of-the-art deep learning models to automatically classify transit signals in the Kepler dataset as either exoplanets or false positives. Here we expand upon that work by including additional scientific domain knowledge into the convolutional neural network architecture and input representations in order to significantly increase the model performance, in particular for the lowest signal-to-noise transits that can represent the most interesting cases of rocky planets in the habitable zone. Specifically, we input into the network the centroid time-series data derived from the Kepler Target Pixel File images as well as key stellar parameters from the Kepler Object of Interest catalog. We also implement additional data augmentation techniques to alleviate model over-fitting. These improvements allow us to drastically reduce the size of the model, while still maintaining improved performance; smaller models are better for generalization, for example from Kepler to TESS data. In sum, this work illustrates the importance of including expert domain knowledge in even state-of-the-art deep learning models when applying them to scientific research problems that seek to identify weak signals in noisy data. This classification tool will be especially useful for the next generation of space-based photometry missions focused on finding small planets, such as TESS and PLATO.},

abstract = {Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation plays an important role in determining chemical abundances in protoplanetary disks. H I Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) is suspected to be the dominant component of the FUV emission from Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs), but is difficult to measure directly due to circumstellar and interstellar H I absorption. To better characterize the intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ radiation, we present FUV spectra of 14 CTTSs taken with the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph instruments. H2 fluorescence, commonly seen in the spectra of CTTSs, is excited by Ly$\alpha$ photons, providing an indirect measure of the Ly$\alpha$ flux incident upon the warm disk surface. We use observed H2 progression fluxes to reconstruct the CTTS Ly$\alpha$ profiles. The Ly$\alpha$ flux correlates with total measured FUV flux, in agreement with an accretion-related source of FUV emission. With a geometry-independent analysis, we confirm that in accreting T Tauri systems Ly$\alpha$ radiation dominates the FUV flux ({\~{}}1150 {\AA} -1700 {\AA}). In the systems surveyed this one line comprises 70{\%}-90{\%} of the total FUV flux.},

This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz 1 . Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions 2},

abstract = {High-resolution doppler spectroscopy provides a powerful means for chemical detections in exoplanetary atmospheres. This approach involves monitoring hundreds of molecular lines in the planetary spectrum doppler shifted by the orbital motion of the planet. The molecules are detected by cross-correlating the observed spectrum of the system with a model planetary spectrum. The method has led to molecular detections of H 2 O, CO, and TiO in hot Jupiters using large ground-based telescopes. Critical to this method, however, is the accurate removal of the stellar and telluric features from the observed spectrum, also known as detrending. Previous molecular detections have relied on specific choices of detrending methods and parameters. However, the robustness of molecular detections across the different choices has not been investigated in detail. We conduct a systematic investigation of the effect of detrending algorithms , parameters, and optimizations on chemical detections using high-resolution spectroscopy. As a case study, we consider the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. Using multiple methods, we confirm high-significance detections of H 2 O (4.8$\sigma$) and CO (4.7$\sigma$). Additionally, we report evidence for HCN at high significance (5.0$\sigma$). On the other hand, our results highlight the need for improved metrics and extended observations for robust confirmations of such detections. In particular, we show that detection sig-nificances of 4$\sigma$ can be obtained by optimizing detrending at incorrect locations in the planetary velocity space; such false positives can occur in nearly 30{\%} of cases. We discuss approaches to help distinguish molecular detections from spurious noise.},

abstract = {We have used Hubble/WFC3 and the G141 grism to measure the secondary eclipse of the transiting, very hot Jupiter CoRoT-2b in the 1.1–1.7 $\mu$m spectral region. We find an eclipse depth averaged over this band equal to 395 +69 −45 parts per million, equivalent to a blackbody temperature of 1788 ± 18 K. We study and characterize several WFC3 instrumental effects, especially the " hook " phenomenon described by Deming et al. We use data from several transiting exoplanet systems to find a quantitative relation between the amplitude of the hook and the exposure level of a given pixel. Although the uncertainties in this relation are too large to allow us to develop an empirical correction for our data, our study provides a useful guide for optimizing exposure levels in future WFC3 observations. We derive the planet's spectrum using a differential method. The planet-to-star contrast increases to longer wavelength within the WFC3 bandpass, but without water absorption or emission to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 85 ppm. The slope of the WFC3 spectrum is significantly less than the slope of the best-fit blackbody. We compare all existing eclipse data for this planet to a blackbody spectrum, and to spectra from both solar abundance and carbon-rich (C/O = 1) models. A blackbody spectrum is an acceptable fit to the full data set. Extra continuous opacity due to clouds or haze, and flattened temperature profiles, are strong candidates to produce quasi-blackbody spectra, and to account for the amplitude of the optical eclipses. Our results show ambiguous evidence for a temperature inversion in this planet.},

Here, we present a new transit observation of Europa that shows a second event at the same location as a previous plume candidate from Sparks et al. (2016), raising the possibility of a consistently active source of erupting material on Europa. This conclusion is bolstered by comparison with a nighttime thermal image from the Galileo Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR) which shows a thermal anomaly at the same location, within the uncertainties (Spencer et al. 1999). The anomaly has the highest observed brightness temperature on the Europa nightside. If heat flow from a subsurface liquid water reservoir causes the thermal anomaly, its depth is {\~{}}1.8-2 km, under simple modeling assumptions, consistent with scenarios in which a liquid water reservoir has formed within a thick ice shell. Models that favor thin regions within the ice shell that connect directly to the ocean, however, cannot be excluded, nor modifications to surface thermal inertia by subsurface activity. Alternatively, vapor deposition surrounding an active vent could increase the thermal inertia of the surface and cause the thermal anomaly. This candidate plume region may offer a promising location for an initial characterization of Europa's internal water and ice and for seeking evidence of Europa's habitability. {\~{}}},

All three wide planetary-mass companions (PMCs) were reported as candidate companions in previous binary survey programs, but then were neglected for {\textgreater}10 yr. We therefore obtained followup observations that demonstrate that each candidate is comoving with its host star. Based on the absolute M K magnitudes, we infer masses (from hot-start evolutionary models) and projected separations of 10 ± 4 M Jup and 330 ± 30 AU for FW Tau b, 16 ± 4 M Jup and 210 ± 20 AU for ROXs 12, and 10 ± 4 M Jup and 140 ± 10 AU for ROXs 42B b. We also present similar observations for 10 other candidates that show that they are unassociated field stars, as well as multicolor JHK L near-infrared photometry for our new PMCs and for five previously identified substellar or planetary-mass companions. The near-infrared photometry for our sample of eight known and new companions generally parallels the properties of free-floating, low-mass brown dwarfs in these star-forming regions. However, five of the seven objects with M {\textless} 30 M Jup are redder in K − L than the distribution of young free-floating counterparts of similar J − K color. We speculate that this distinction could indicate a structural difference in circumplanetary disks, perhaps tied to higher disk mass since at least two of the objects in our sample are known to be accreting more vigorously than typical free-floating counterparts.},

abstract = {Most directly imaged giant exoplanets are fainter than brown dwarfs with similar spectra. To explain their relative underluminosity, unusually cloudy atmospheres have been proposed. However, with multiple parameters varying between any two objects, it remained difficult to observationally test this idea. We present a new method, sensitive time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared spectroscopy, to study two rotating L/T transition brown dwarfs (2M2139 and SIMP0136). The observations provide spatially and spectrally resolved mapping of the cloud decks of the brown dwarfs. The data allow the study of cloud structure variations while other parameters are unchanged. We find that both brown dwarfs display variations of identical nature: J- and H-band brightness variations with minimal color and spectral changes. Our light curve models show that even the simplest surface brightness distributions require at least three elliptical spots. We show that for each source the spectral changes can be reproduced with a linear combination of only two different spectra, i.e., the entire surface is covered by two distinct types of regions. Modeling the color changes and spectral variations together reveal patchy cloud covers consisting of a spatially heterogeneous mix of low-brightness, low-temperature thick clouds and brighter, thin, and warm clouds. We show that the same thick cloud patches seen in our varying brown dwarf targets, if extended to the entire photosphere, predict near-infrared colors/magnitudes matching the range occupied by the directly imaged exoplanets that are cooler and less luminous than brown dwarfs with similar spectral types. This supports the models in which thick clouds are responsible for the near-infrared properties of these underluminous exoplanets.},

abstract = {Extrasolar planets on eccentric short-period orbits provide a laboratory in which to study radiative and tidal interactions between a planet and its host star under extreme forcing conditions. Studying such systems probes how the planet's atmosphere redistributes the time-varying heat flux from its host and how the host star responds to transient tidal distortion. Here, we report the insights into the planet-star interactions in HAT-P-2's eccentric planetary system gained from the analysis of ∼350 hours of 4.5 µm observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The observations show no sign of orbit-to-orbit variability nor of orbital evolution of the eccentric planetary companion, HAT-P-2 b. The extensive coverage allows us to better differentiate instrumental systematics from the transient heating of HAT-P-2 b's 4.5 µm photosphere and yields the detection of stellar pulsations with an amplitude of approximately 40 ppm. These pulsation modes correspond to exact harmonics of the planet's orbital frequency, indicative of a tidal origin. Transient tidal effects can excite pulsation modes in the envelope of a star but, to date, such pulsations had only been detected in highly-eccentric stellar binaries. Current stellar models are unable to reproduce HAT-P-2's pulsations, suggesting that our understanding of the interactions at play in this system is incomplete.},

abstract = {Here we advocate an observational strategy to help prioritize exoplanet observations. It starts with more easily obtained observational data, and ranks exoplanets for more difficult follow-up observations based on the likelihood of avoiding planets for which oxygen is a false positives or even an inconclusive signature of life. We find that for oxygen to be a robust biosignature, both land and surface water must be present. Landless exoplanets have much slower biogeochemical cycles, so while oxygenic photosynthesizing life could exist on such planets, it could not produce oxygen at a rate competitive with abiotic rates such as photolysis. These habitable planets, whose life would not be detectable, should be avoided.},

abstract = {Modern radio pulsar surveys produce a large volume of prospective candidates, the majority of which are polluted by human-created radio frequency interference or other forms of noise. Typically, large numbers of candidates need to be visually inspected in order to determine if they are real pulsars. This process can be labor intensive. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm called PEACE (Pulsar Evaluation Algorithm for Candidate Extraction) which improves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. The algorithm ranks the candidates based on a score function. Unlike popular machine-learning based algorithms, no prior training data sets are required. This algorithm has been applied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. Using the human-based ranking results generated by students in the Arecibo Remote Command enter programme, the statistical performance of PEACE was evaluated. It was found that PEACE ranked 68{\%} of the student-identified pulsars within the top 0.17{\%} of sorted candidates, 95{\%} within the top 0.34{\%}, and 100{\%} within the top 3.7{\%}. This clearly demonstrates that PEACE significantly increases the pulsar identification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. To date, PEACE has been directly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which are millisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing based gravitational-wave detection projects.},

abstract = {We present a retrieval method based on Bayesian analysis to infer the atmospheric compositions and surface or cloud-top pressures from transmission spectra of exoplanets with general compositions. In this study, we identify what can unambiguously be determined about the atmospheres of exoplanets from their transmission spectra by applying the retrieval method to synthetic observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b. Our approach to infer constraints on atmospheric parameters is to compute their joint and marginal posterior probability distributions using the MCMC technique in a parallel tempering scheme. A new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable to general atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori and clouds may be present. Our main finding is that a unique constraint of the mixing ratios of the absorbers and up to two spectrally inactive gases (such as N2 and primordial H2+He) is possible if the observations are sufficient to quantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorption feature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecular Rayleigh scattering signature. The surface or cloud-top pressure can be quantified if a surface or cloud deck is present. The mean molecular mass can be constrained from the Rayleigh slope or the shapes of absorption features, thus enabling to distinguish between cloudy hydrogen-rich atmospheres and high mean molecular mass atmospheres. We conclude, however, that without the signature of Rayleigh scattering--even with robustly detected infrared absorption features--there is no reliable way to tell if the absorber is the main constituent of the atmosphere or just a minor species with a mixing ratio of {\textless}0.1{\%}. The retrieval method leads us to a conceptual picture of which details in transmission spectra are essential for unique characterizations of well-mixed atmospheres.},

abstract = {All water-covered rocky planets in the inner habitable zones of solar-type stars will in-evitably experience a catastrophic runaway climate due to increasing stellar luminosity and limits to outgoing infrared radiation from wet greenhouse atmospheres. Reflectors or scatterers placed near Earth's inner Lagrange point (L 1) have been proposed as a " geo-engineering " solution to anthropogenic climate change and an advanced version of this could modulate incident irradiation over many Gyr or " rescue " a planet from the interior of the habitable zone. The distance of the starshade from the planet that minimizes its mass is 1.6 times the Earth-L 1 distance. Such a starshade would have to be similar in size to the planet and the mutual occultations during planetary transits could produce a characteristic maximum at mid-transit in the light-curve. Because of a fortuitous ratio of densities, Earth-size planets around G dwarf stars present the best opportunity to detect such an artifact. The signal would be persistent and is potentially detectable by a future space photometry mission to characterize transiting planets. The signal could be distinguished from natural phenomenon, i.e. starspots or cometary dust clouds, by its shape, persistence, and transmission spectrum.},

abstract = {A number of brown dwarfs are now known to be variable with observed amplitudes as large as 10-30{\%} at some wavelengths. While spatial inhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for much of the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arise from atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to, clouds. To better understand the role that thermal variability might play we present a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developed one-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. We focus on the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem through omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results demonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at pressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the upper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared water opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal perturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations, the emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent behaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at different wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in the atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative exchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation evolves in time. We conclude that thermal--as well as cloud--fluctuations must be considered as possible contributors to the observed brown dwarf variability.},

abstract = {We present commissioning data from the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph (IFS) on the Keck II 10 m telescope that demonstrate the utility of adaptive optics IFS spectroscopy in studying faint close-in substellar companions in the halos of bright stars. Our R{\~{}}2000 J- and H-band spectra of the substellar companion to the 1-10 Myr old GQ Lup complement existing K-band spectra and photometry and improve on the original estimate of its spectral type. We find that GQ Lup B is somewhat hotter (M6-L0) than reported in the discovery paper by Neuh{\"{a}}user and collaborators (M9-L4), mainly due to the surface gravity sensitivity of the K-band spectral classification indices used by the discoverers. Spectroscopic features characteristic of low surface gravity objects, such as lack of alkali absorption and a triangular H-band continuum, are indeed prominent in our spectrum of GQ Lup B. The peculiar shape of the H-band continuum and the difference between the two spectral type estimates is well explained in the context of the diminishing strength of H2 collision-induced absorption with decreasing surface gravity, as recently proposed for young ultracool dwarfs by Kirkpatrick and collaborators. Using our updated spectroscopic classification of GQ Lup B and a reevaluation of the age and heliocentric distance of the primary, we perform a comparative analysis of the available substellar evolutionary models to estimate the mass of the companion. We find that the mass of GQ Lup B is 0.010-0.040 Msolar. Hence, it is unlikely to be a wide-orbit counterpart to the known radial velocity extrasolar planets, whose masses are {\textless}{\~{}}0.015 Msolar. Instead, GQ Lup A/B is probably a member of a growing family of very low mass ratio widely separated binaries discovered through high-contrast imaging.},

We here report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets HD209458b and XO-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum photon-collecting efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives the exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly decorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited precision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. Our errors are within 6-percent (XO-1) and 26-percent (HD209458b) of the photon-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than 0.01-percent per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. Our result for XO-1b contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The weak water absorption we measure for HD209458b is reminiscent of the weakness of sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet atmosphere by Charbonneau et al. (2002). Model atmospheres having uniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm{\^{}}2 per gram account approximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in this planet. Our results for HD209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al. (2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission spectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust. However, the extra opacity needed for HD209458b is grayer than for HD189733b, with a weaker Rayleigh component.},

abstract = {One of the most directly observable features of a transiting multi-planet system is their size-ordering when ranked in orbital separation. Kepler has revealed a rich diversity of outcomes, from perfectly ordered systems, like Kepler-80, to ostensibly disordered systems, like Kepler-20. Under the hypothesis that systems are born via preferred formation pathways, one might reasonably expect non-random size-orderings reflecting these processes. However, subsequent dynamical evolution, often chaotic and turbulent in nature, may erode this information and so here we ask - do systems remember how they formed? To address this, we devise a model to define the entropy of a planetary system's size-ordering, by first comparing differences between neighboring planets and then extending to accommodate differences across the chain. We derive closed-form solutions for many of the micro state occupancies and provide public code with look-up tables to compute entropy for up to ten-planet systems. All three proposed entropy definitions exhibit the expected property that their credible interval increases with respect to a proxy for time. We find that the observed Kepler multis display a highly significant deficit in entropy compared to a randomly generated population. Incorporating a filter for systems deemed likely to be dynamically packed, we show that this result is robust against the possibility of missing planets too. Put together, our work establishes that Kepler systems do indeed remember something of their younger years and highlights the value of information theory for exoplanetary science.},

abstract = {The C/O ratio is predicted to regulate the atmospheric chemistry in hot Jupiters. Recent observations suggest that some exoplanets, e.g., Wasp 12-b, have atmospheric C/O ratios substantially different from the solar value of 0.54. In this Letter, we present a mechanism that can produce such atmospheric deviations from the stellar C/O ratio. In protoplanetary disks, different snowlines of oxygen-and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon monoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas and in the condensed phases. In particular, between the H 2 O and CO snowlines most oxygen is present in icy grains-the building blocks of planetary cores in the core accretion model-while most carbon remains in the gas phase. This region is coincidental with the giant-planet-forming zone for a range of observed protoplanetary disks. Based on standard core accretion models of planet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from disk gas outside of the water snowline will have a C/O ∼ 1, while atmospheres significantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have a stellar or substellar C/O when formed at the same disk radius. The overall metallicity will also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may therefore provide constraints on where and how a specific planet formed.},

Clouds affect every aspect of a planetary atmosphere, from the transport of radiation, to atmospheric chemistry, to dynamics and they influence - if not control - aspects such as surface temperature and habitability. In this review we aim to provide an introduction to the role and properties of clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres. We consider the role clouds play in influencing the spectra of planets as well as their habitability and detectability. We briefly summarize how clouds are treated in terrestrial climate models and consider the far simpler approaches that have been taken so far to model exoplanet clouds, the evidence for which we also review. Since clouds play a major role in the atmospheres of certain classes of brown dwarfs we briefly discuss brown dwarf cloud modeling as well. We also review how the scattering and extinction efficiencies of cloud particles may be approximated in certain limiting cases of small and large particles in order to facilitate physical understanding. Since clouds play such important roles in planetary atmospheres, cloud modeling may well prove to be the limiting factor in our ability to interpret future observations of extrasolar planets.},

abstract = {The discovery of many planets using the Kepler telescope includes ten planets orbiting eight binary stars. Three binaries, Kepler-16, Kepler-47, and Kepler-453, have at least one planet in the circumbinary habitable-zone (BHZ). We constrain the level of high-energy radiation and the plasma environment in the BHZ of these systems. With this aim, BHZ limits in these Kepler binaries are calculated as a function of time, and the habitability lifetimes are estimated for hypothetical terrestrial planets and/or moons within the BHZ. With the time-dependent BHZ limits established, a self-consistent model is developed describing the evolution of stellar activity and radiation properties as proxies for stellar aggression toward planetary atmospheres. Modeling binary stellar rotation evolution, including the effect of tidal interaction between stars in binaries is key to establishing the environment around these systems. We find that Kepler-16 and its binary analogs provide a plasma environment favorable for the survival of atmospheres of putative Mars-sized planets and exomoons. Tides have modified the rotation of the stars in Kepler-47 making its radiation environment less harsh in comparison to the solar system. This is a good example of the mechanism first proposed by Mason et al. Kepler-453 has an environment similar to that of the solar system with slightly better than Earth radiation conditions at the inner edge of the BHZ. These results can be reproduced and even reparametrized as stellar evolution and binary tidal models progress, using our online tool http://bhmcalc.net.},

abstract = {The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) standard has been a great boon to astronomy, allowing observatories, scientists and the public to exchange astronomical information easily. The FITS standard is, however, showing its age. Developed in the late 1970s the FITS authors made a number of implementation choices for the format that, while common at the time, are now seen to limit its utility with modern data. The authors of the FITS standard could not appreciate the challenges which we would be facing today in astronomical computing. Difficulties we now face include, but are not limited to, having to address the need to handle an expanded range of specialized data product types (data models), being more conducive to the networked exchange and storage of data, handling very large datasets and the need to capture significantly more complex metadata and data relationships. There are members of the community today who find some (or all) of these limitations unworkable, and have decided to move ahead with storing data in other formats. This reaction should be taken as a wakeup call to the FITS community to make changes in the FITS standard, or to see its usage fall. In this paper we detail some selected important problems which exist within the FITS standard today. It is not our intention to prescribe specific remedies to these issues; rather, we hope to call attention of the FITS and greater astronomical computing communities to these issues in the hopes that it will spur action to address them.},

WASP-33b is the most highly irradiated hot Jupiter discovered to date, and the only exoplanet known to orbit a $\delta$-Scuti star. We observed in spatial scan mode to decrease instrument systematic effects in the data, and removed fluctuations in the data due to stellar pulsations. The rms for our final, binned spectrum is 1.05 times the photon noise. We compare our final spectrum, along with previously published photometric data, to atmospheric models of WASP-33b spanning a wide range in temperature profiles and chemical compositions. We find that the data require models with an oxygen-rich chemical composition and a temperature profile that increases at high altitude. We find that our measured spectrum displays an excess in the measured flux toward short wavelengths that is best explained as emission from TiO. If confirmed by additional measurements at shorter wavelengths, this planet would become the first hot Jupiter with a thermal inversion that can be definitively attributed to the presence of TiO in its dayside atmosphere.},

abstract = {Atmospheric chemical disequilibrium has been proposed as a method for detecting extraterrestrial biospheres from exoplanet observations. Chemical disequilibrium is potentially a generalized biosignature since it makes no assumptions about particular biogenic gases or metabolisms. Here, we present the first rigorous calculations of the thermodynamic chemical disequilibrium in the atmospheres of Solar System planets, in which we quantify the difference in Gibbs free energy of an observed atmosphere compared to that of all the atmospheric gases reacted to equilibrium. The purely gas phase disequilibrium in Earth's atmosphere, as measured by this available Gibbs free energy, is not unusual by Solar System standards and smaller than that of Mars. However, Earth's atmosphere is in contact with a surface ocean, which means that gases can react with water, and so a multiphase calculation that includes aqueous species is required. We find that the disequilibrium in Earth's atmosphere-ocean system (in joules per mole of atmosphere) ranges from {\~{}}20 to 2E6 times larger than the disequilibria of other atmospheres in the Solar System depending on the celestial body being compared. Disequilibrium in other Solar System atmospheres is driven by abiotic processes, and we identify the key disequilibria in each atmosphere. Earth's thermodynamic disequilibrium is biogenic in origin, and the main contribution is the coexistence of N2, O2 and liquid water instead of more stable nitrate. In comparison, the disequilibrium between O2 and methane constitutes a negligible contribution to Earth's disequilibrium with this metric. Our metric requires minimal assumptions and could potentially be calculated using observations of exoplanet atmospheres. Our Matlab source code and associated databases for these calculations are available as open source software.},

For 8 objects we obtained high resolution H$\alpha$ profiles and determined mass accretion rate $\backslash$dot Mac and accretion luminosity Lac. Pa$\backslash$beta is detected in emission in 7 of the 10 $\rho$ Oph objects, but only in one in Cha I. Using objects for which we have both a determination of Lac from H$\alpha$ and a Pa$\beta$ detection,{\}} we show that the correlation between the Pa$\beta$ luminosity and luminosity Lac, found by Muzerolle et al. ($\backslash$cite{\{}Mea98{\}}) for T Tauri stars in Taurus, extends to objects with mass ˜0.03 M⊙; L(Pa$\beta$) can be used to measure Lac also in the substellar regime. The results were less conclusive for Br$\gamma$, which was detected only in 2 objects, neither of which had an H$\alpha$ estimate of $\backslash$dot Mac. Using the relation between L(Pa$\backslash$beta) and Lac we determined the accretion rate for all the objects in our sample (including those with no H$\alpha$ spectrum), {\}} more than doubling the number of substellar objects with known $\backslash$dot Mac. When plotted as a function of the mass of the central object together with data from the literature, our results confirm the trend of lower $\backslash$dot Mac for lower M*, although with a large spread. Some of the spread is probably due to an age effect; our very young objects in $\rho$ Oph have on average an accretion rate at least one order of magnitude higher than objects of similar mass in older regions. As a side product, we found that the width of H$\alpha$ measured at 10{\%} peak intensity is not only a qualitative indicator of the accreting nature of very low mass objects, but can be used to obtain a quantitative, although not very accurate, estimate of $\backslash$dot Mac over a large mass range, from T Tauri stars to brown dwarfs. Finally, we found that some of our objects show evidence of mass-loss in their optical spectra. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile.

abstract = {While scattering of light by atoms and molecules yields large amount of polarization at the B-band of both T- and L-dwarfs, scattering by dust grains in cloudy atmosphere of L-dwarfs gives rise to significant polarization at the far-optical and infra-red wavelengths where these objects are much brighter. However, the observable disk averaged polarization should be zero if the clouds are uniformly distributed and the object is spherically symmetric. Therefore, in order to explain the observed large polarization of several L-dwarfs, rotation-induced oblateness or horizontally inhomogeneous cloud distribution in the atmosphere is invoked. On the other hand, when an extra-solar planet of Earth-size or larger transits the brown dwarf along the line of sight, the asymmetry induced during the transit gives rise to a net non-zero, time dependent polarization. Employing atmospheric models for a range of effective temperature and surface gravity appropriate for T- and L-dwarfs, I derive the time dependent polarization profiles of these objects during transit phase and estimate the peak amplitude of polarization that occurs during the inner contact points of the transit ingress/egress phase. It is found that peak polarization in the range of 0.2-1.0 {\%} at I- and J-band may arise of cloudy L dwarfs occulted by Earth-size or larger exoplanets. Such an amount of polarization is higher than that can be produced by rotation-induced oblateness of even the rapidly rotating L-dwarfs. Hence, I suggest that time resolved imaging polarization should be a potential technique to detect transiting exoplanets around L-dwarfs.},

abstract = {Interpixel capacitance (IPC) is a deterministic electronic coupling by which signal generated in one pixel is measured in neighboring pixels. Examination of dark frames from test NIRcam arrays corroborates earlier results and simulations illustrating a signal dependent coupling. When the signal on an individual pixel is larger, the fractional coupling to nearest neighbors is lesser than when the signal is lower. Frames from test arrays indicate a drop in average coupling from approximately 1.0{\%} at low signals down to approximately 0.65{\%} at high signals depending on the particular array in question. The photometric ramifications for this non-uniformity are not fully understood. This non-uniformity intro-duces a non-linearity in the current mathematical model for IPC coupling. IPC coupling has been mathematically formalized as convolution by a blur kernel. Signal dependence requires that the blur kernel be locally defined as a function of signal intensity. Through application of a signal dependent coupling kernel, the IPC coupling can be modeled computationally. This method allows for simultaneous knowledge of the intrinsic parameters of the image scene, the result of applying a constant IPC, and the result of a signal dependent IPC. In the age of sub-pixel precision in astronomy these effects must be properly understood and accounted for in order for the data to accurately represent the object of observation. Implementation of this method is done through python scripted processing of images. The introduction of IPC into simulated frames is accomplished through convolution of the image with a blur kernel whose parameters are themselves locally defined functions of the image. These techniques can be used to enhance the data processing pipeline for NIRcam.},

abstract = {We present J-band imaging and H+K-band low-resolution spectroscopy of 2MASS 1207-3932AB, obtained with VLT NACO. For the putative planetary mass secondary, we find J = 20.0 ± 0.2 mag. The HK spectra of both components imply low gravity and a dusty atmosphere for the secondary. Comparisons to synthetic spectra yield Teff,A ≈ 2550 ± 150 K and Teff,B ≈ 1600 ± 100 K, consistent with their late-M and mid- to late-L types. For these Teff and an age of 5-10 Myr, evolutionary models imply MA ≈ 24 ± 6 MJup and MB ≈ 8 ± 2 MJup. Independent comparisons of these models to the observed colors, spanning {\~{}}I to L', also yield the same masses and temperatures. Our primary mass agrees with other recent analyses; however, our secondary mass, while still in the planetary regime, is 2-3 times larger than claimed previously. This discrepancy can be traced to the luminosities: while the absolute photometry and Mbol of the primary agree with theoretical predictions, the secondary is {\~{}}2.5 ± 0.5 mag fainter than expected in all bands from I to L' and in Mbol. This accounts for the much lower secondary mass (and temperature) derived earlier. We argue that this effect is highly unlikely to result from a variety of model-related problems and is instead real. This conclusion is bolstered by the absence of any luminosity problems in either the primary or AB Pic B, which we also analyze. We therefore suggest gray extinction in 2M1207B, due to occlusion by an edge-on circumsecondary disk. This is consistent with the observed properties of edge-on disks around T Tauri stars and with the known presence of a high-inclination evolved disk around the primary. Finally, the system's implied mass ratio of {\~{}}0.3 suggests a binary-like formation scenario.},

abstract = {We present and analyze three-dimensional data cubes of Neptune from the OSIRIS integral-field spectrograph on the 10-meter W.M. Keck II telescope, from 26 July 2009. These data have a spatial resolution of 0.035 " /pixel and spectral resolution of R∼3800 in the H (1.47–1.80 µm) and K (1.97–2.38 µm) broad bands. We focus our analysis on regions of Neptune's atmosphere that are near-infrared dark – that is, free of discrete bright cloud features. We use a forward model coupled to a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to retrieve properties of Neptune's aerosol structure and methane profile above ∼ 4 bar in these near-infrared dark regions. We construct a set of high signal-to-noise spectra spanning a range of viewing ge-ometries to constrain the vertical structure of Neptune's aerosols in a cloud-free lat-itude band from 2–12 • N. We find that Neptune's cloud opacity at these wavelengths is dominated by a compact, optically thick cloud layer with a base near 3 bar. Using the pyDISORT algorithm for the radiative transfer and assuming a Henyey-Greenstein phase function, we observe this cloud to be composed of low albedo (single scattering albedo = 0.45 +0.01 −0.01), forward scattering (asymmetry parameter g = 0.50 +0.02 −0.02) parti-cles, with an assumed characteristic size of ∼ 1µm. Above this cloud, we require an aerosol layer of smaller (∼ 0.1µm) particles forming a vertically extended haze, which reaches from the upper troposphere (0.59 +0.04 −0.03 bar) into the stratosphere. The particles in this haze are brighter (single scattering albedo = 0.91 +0.06 −0.05) and more isotropically scattering (asymmetry parameter g = 0.24 +0.02 −0.03) than those in the deep cloud. When we extend our analysis to 18 cloud-free locations from 20 • N to 87 • S, we observe that the optical depth in aerosols above 0.5 bar decreases by a factor of 2–3 or more at mid-and high-southern latitudes relative to low latitudes. We also consider Neptune's methane (CH 4) profile, and find that our retrievals indi-cate a strong preference for a low methane relative humidity at pressures where methane is expected to condense. When we include in our fits a parameter for methane depletion below the CH 4 condensation pressure, our preferred solution at most locations is for a methane relative humidity below 10{\%} near the tropopause in addition to methane depletion down to 2.0–2.5 bar. We tentatively identify a trend of lower CH 4 columns above 2.5 bar at mid-and high-southern latitudes over low latitudes, qualitatively con-sistent with what is found by Karkoschka and Tomasko (2011), and similar to, but weaker than, the trend observed for Uranus.},

abstract = {We present X-Shooter/VLT observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-mass stellar and sub-stellar objects (YSOs) in the Lupus star forming region, spanning a range in mass from {\~{}}0.03 to {\~{}}1.2Msun, but mostly with 0.1Msun {\textless} Mstar {\textless} 0.5Msun. Our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship between excess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, to investigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of the central object. The accretion luminosity (Lacc), and from it the accretion rate (Macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the UV to the near-IR, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. The flux and luminosity (Ll) of a large number of emission lines of H, He, CaII, etc., observed simultaneously in the range from {\~{}}330nm to 2500nm, were computed. The luminosity of all the lines is well correlated with Lacc. We provide empirical relationships between Lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which have a lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. Our measurements extend the Pab and Brg relationships to Lacc values about two orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. We confirm that different methodologies to measure Lacc and Macc yield significantly different results: Ha line profile modelling may underestimate Macc by 0.6 to 0.8dex with respect to Macc derived from continuum-excess measures. Such differences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between Macc and other YSOs properties reported in the literature. We derive Macc in the range 2e-12 -- 4e-8 Msun/yr and conclude that Macc is proportional to Mstar{\^{}}1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than in previous studies. A number of properties indicate that the physical conditions of the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in Macc.},

With an orbital period of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}11 days, the surface of Proxima Centauri b is temperate and might be habitable. We took a photometric monitoring campaign to search for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica. A transit--like signal appearing on September 8th, 2016, is identified tentatively. Its midtime, {\$}T{\_}{\{}C{\}}=2,457,640.1990\backslashpm0.0017{\$}{\~{}}HJD, is consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence interval. Time--correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of Proxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence level of {\$}2.5\backslashsigma{\$}. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to confirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b.

If all the signals are real transits, the misalignment of the epochs plausibly suggests transit timing variations of Proxima Centauri b induced by an outer planet in this system.},

abstract = {The system of four planets around HR8799 offers a unique opportunity to probe the physics and chemistry at play in the atmospheres of self-luminous young ({\~{}}30 Myr) planets. We recently obtained new photometry of the four planets and low-resolution (R{\~{}}30) spectra of HR8799 d and e with the SPHERE instrument (paper III). In this paper (paper IV), we compare the available spectra and photometry of the planets to known objects and atmospheric models (BT-SETTL14, Cloud-AE60, Exo-REM) to characterize the atmospheric properties of the planets. We find that HR8799d and e properties are well reproduced by those of L6-L8 dusty dwarfs discovered in the field, among which some are candidate members of young nearby associations. No known object reproduces well the properties of planets b and c. Nevertheless, we find that the spectra and WISE photometry of peculiar and/or young early-T dwarfs reddened by submicron grains made of corundum, iron, enstatite, or forsterite successfully reproduce the SED of these two planets. Our analysis confirms that only the Exo-REM models with thick clouds fit (within 2{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}) the whole set of spectrophotometric datapoints available for HR8799 d and e for Teff = 1200 K, log g in the range 3.0-4.5, and M/H=+0.5. The models still fail to reproduce the SED of HR8799c and b. The determination of the metallicity, log g, and cloud thickness are degenerate. We conclude that an enhanced content in dust and decreased CIA of H2 is certainly responsible for the deviation of the properties of the planet with respect to field dwarfs. The analysis suggests in addition that HR8799c and b have later spectral types than the two other planets, and therefore could both have lower masses.},

abstract = {Many parameters constraining the spectral appearance of exoplanets are still poorly understood. We therefore study the properties of irradiated exoplanet atmospheres over a wide parameter range including metallicity, C/O ratio and host spectral type. We calculate a grid of 1-d radiative-convective atmospheres and emission spectra. We perform the calculations with our new Pressure-Temperature Iterator and Spectral Emission Calculator for Planetary Atmospheres (PETIT) code, assuming chemical equilibrium. The atmospheric structures and spectra are made available online. We find that atmospheres of planets with C/O ratios {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 1 and {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} {\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 1500 K can exhibit inversions due to heating by the alkalis because the main coolants CH{\$}{\_}4{\$}, H{\$}{\_}2{\$}O and HCN are depleted. Therefore, temperature inversions possibly occur without the presence of additional absorbers like TiO and VO. At low temperatures we find that the pressure level of the photosphere strongly influences whether the atmospheric opacity is dominated by either water (for low C/O) or methane (for high C/O), or both (regardless of the C/O). For hot, carbon-rich objects this pressure level governs whether the atmosphere is dominated by methane or HCN. Further we find that host stars of late spectral type lead to planetary atmospheres which have shallower, more isothermal temperature profiles. In agreement with prior work we find that for planets with {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} {\$}{\textless}{\$} 1750 K the transition between water or methane dominated spectra occurs at C/O {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.7, instead of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 1, because condensation preferentially removes oxygen.},

abstract = {Measurements of accretion rates onto planetary mass objects may distinguish between different planet formation mechanisms, which predict different accretion histories. In this Letter, we use Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 UVIS optical photometry to measure accretion rates onto three accreting objects, GSC 06214-00210 b, GQ Lup b, and DH Tau b, that are at the planet/brown dwarf boundary and are companions to solar mass stars. The excess optical emission in the excess accretion continuum yields mass accretion rates of 10-9-10-11 M ☉ yr-1 for these three objects. Their accretion rates are an order of magnitude higher than expected from the correlation between mass and accretion rates measured from the UV excess, which is applicable if these wide planetary mass companions formed by protostellar core fragmentation. The high accretion rates and large separation from the central star demonstrate the presence of massive disks around these objects. Models for the formation and evolution of wide planetary mass companions should account for their large accretion rates. High ratios of H$\alpha$ luminosity over accretion luminosity for objects with low accretion rates suggest that searches for H$\alpha$ emission may be an efficient way to find accreting planets.},

abstract = {We re-visit the principles of transmission spectroscopy for transiting extrasolar planets, focusing on the overlap between the planetary spectrum and the illuminating stellar spectrum. Virtually all current models of exoplanetary transmission spectra utilize an approximation that is inaccurate when the spec-trum of the illuminating star has a complex line structure, such as molecular bands in M-dwarf spectra. In those cases, it is desirable to model the observations using a coupled stellar-planetary radiative trans-fer model calculated at high spectral resolving power, followed by convolution to the observed resolution. Not consistently accounting for overlap of stellar M-dwarf and planetary lines at high spectral resolu-tion can bias the modeled amplitude of the exoplanetary transmission spectrum, producing modeled absorption that is too strong. We illustrate this bias using the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1b, as observed using HST/WFC3. The bias in this case is about 250 parts-per-million, 12{\%} of the modeled transit absorption. Transit spectroscopy using JWST will have access to longer wavelengths where the water bands are intrinsically stronger, and the observed signal-to-noise ratios will be higher than currently possible. We therefore expect that this resolution-linked bias will be especially important for future JWST observations of TESS-discovered super-Earths and mini-Neptunes transiting M-dwarfs.},

We conservatively restrict our attention to the context of "life as we know it" and the standard cosmological model, LCDM. We find that unless habitability around low mass stars is suppressed, life is most likely to exist near 0.1 solar-mass stars ten trillion years from now.

Studies of atmospheric escape from exoplanets have mostly relied on space-based observations of the hydrogen Lyman-{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} line in the far ultraviolet which is strongly affected by interstellar absorption. Using ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy we detect excess absorption in the helium triplet at 1083 nm during the transit of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-69b, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 18. We measure line blue shifts of several km/s and post transit absorption, which we interpret as the escape of part of the atmosphere trailing behind the planet in comet-like form. [Additional notes by authors: Furthermore, we provide upper limits for helium signals in the atmospheres of the exoplanets HD 209458b, KELT-9b, and GJ 436b. We investigate the host stars of all planets with detected helium signals and those of the three planets we derive upper limits for. In each case we calculate the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet flux received by these planets. We find that helium is detected in the atmospheres of planets (orbiting the more active stars and) receiving the larger amount of irradiation from their host stars.]},

abstract = {Refraction deflects photons that pass through atmospheres, which affects transit light curves. Refraction thus provides an avenue to probe physical properties of exoplanet atmospheres and to constrain the presence of clouds and hazes. In addition, an effective surface can be imposed by refraction, thereby limiting the pressure levels probed by transmission spectroscopy. The main objective of the paper is to model the effects of refraction on photometric light curves for realistic planets and to explore the dependencies on atmospheric physical parameters. We also explore under which circumstances transmission spectra are significantly affected by refraction. Finally, we search for refraction signatures in photometric residuals in Kepler data. We use the model of Hui {\&} Seager (2002) to compute deflection angles and refraction transit light curves, allowing us to explore the parameter space of atmospheric properties. The observational search is performed by stacking large samples of transit light curves from Kepler. We find that out-of-transit refraction shoulders are the most easily observable features, which can reach peak amplitudes of {\~{}}10 parts per million (ppm) for planets around Sun-like stars. More typical amplitudes are a few ppm or less for Jovians and at the sub-ppm level for super-Earths. Interestingly, the signal-to-noise ratio of any refraction residuals for planets orbiting Sun-like hosts are expected to be similar for planets orbiting red dwarfs. We also find that the maximum depth probed by transmission spectroscopy is not limited by refraction for weakly lensing planets, but that the incidence of refraction can vary significantly for strongly lensing planets. We find no signs of refraction features in the stacked Kepler light curves, which is in agreement with our model predictions.},

abstract = {We report an analysis of transit spectroscopy of the extrasolar planets WASP-12 b, WASP-17 b, and WASP-19 b using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We analyze the data for a single transit for each planet using a strategy similar, in certain aspects, to the techniques used by Berta et al., but we extend their methodology to allow us to correct for channel- or wavelength-dependent instrumental effects by utilizing the band-integrated time series and measurements of the drift of the spectrum on the detector over time. We achieve almost photon-limited results for individual spectral bins, but the uncertainties in the transit depth for the band-integrated data are exacerbated by the uneven sampling of the light curve imposed by the orbital phasing of HST's observations. Our final transit spectra for all three objects are consistent with the presence of a broad absorption feature at 1.4 $\mu$m most likely due to water. However, the amplitude of the absorption is less than that expected based on previous observations with Spitzer, possibly due to hazes absorbing in the NIR or non-solar compositions. The degeneracy of models with different compositions and temperature structures combined with the low amplitude of any features in the data preclude our ability to place unambiguous constraints on the atmospheric composition without additional observations with WFC3 to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and/or a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis.},

abstract = {M-dwarf stars -- hydrogen-burning stars that are smaller than 60 per cent of the size of the Sun -- are the most common class of star in our Galaxy and outnumber Sun-like stars by a ratio of 12:1. Recent results have shown that M dwarfs host Earth-sized planets in great numbers: the average number of M-dwarf planets that are between 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of Earth is at least 1.4 per star. The nearest such planets known to transit their star are 39 parsecs away, too distant for detailed follow-up observations to measure the planetary masses or to study their atmospheres. Here we report observations of GJ 1132b, a planet with a size of 1.2 Earth radii that is transiting a small star 12 parsecs away. Our Doppler mass measurement of GJ 1132b yields a density consistent with an Earth-like bulk composition, similar to the compositions of the six known exoplanets with masses less than six times that of the Earth and precisely measured densities. Receiving 19 times more stellar radiation than the Earth, the planet is too hot to be habitable but is cool enough to support a substantial atmosphere, one that has probably been considerably depleted of hydrogen. Because the host star is nearby and only 21 per cent the radius of the Sun, existing and upcoming telescopes will be able to observe the composition and dynamics of the planetary atmosphere.},

abstract = {Exoplanet atmosphere spectroscopy enables us to improve our understanding of exoplanets just as remote sensing in our own solar system has increased our understanding of the solar system bodies. The challenge is to quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and molecular abundances allowed by the data, which is often difficult given the low information content of most exoplanet spectra that commonly leads to degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of spectral retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous investigations have sought to compare these approaches. We compare three different retrieval methods: optimal estimation, differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo, and bootstrap Monte Carlo on a synthetic water-dominated hot Jupiter. We discuss expectations of uncertainties in abundances and temperatures given current and potential future observations. In general, we find that the three approaches agree for high spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise data expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but disagree for low-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra representative of current observations. We also compare the results from a parameterized temperature profile versus a full classical Level-by-Level approach and discriminate in which situations each of these approaches is applicable. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C-toO ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres. Specifically, we show that in the observational limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased toward values near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors.},

abstract = {The outer Solar System may provide a potential habitat for extraterrestrial life. Remote sensing data from the Galileo spacecraft suggest that the jovian icy moons-Europa, Ganymede, and possibly Callisto-may harbor liquid water oceans underneath their icy crusts. Although compositional information required for the discussion of habitability is limited because of significantly restricted observation data, organic molecules are ubiquitous in the Universe. Recently, in situ spacecraft measurements and experiments suggest that amino acids can be formed abiotically on interstellar ices and comets. These amino acids could be continuously delivered by meteorite or comet impacts to icy moons. Here, we show that polymerization of organic monomers, in particular amino acids and nucleotides, could proceed spontaneously in the cold environment of icy moons, in particular the jovian icy moon Europa as a typical example, based on thermodynamic calculations, though kinetics of formation are not addressed. Observed surface temperature on Europa is 120 and 80 K in the equatorial region and polar region, respectively. At such low temperatures, Gibbs energies of polymerization become negative, and the estimated thermal structure of the icy crust should contain a shallow region (i.e., at a depth of only a few kilometers) favorable for polymerization. Investigation of the possibility of organic monomer polymerization on icy moons could provide good constraints on the origin and early evolution of extraterrestrial life.

Lightning is a tracer of atmospheric convection, cloud formation and ionization processes as known from the Solar System, and may be significant for the formation of prebiotic molecules. We study lightning climatology for the different atmospheric environments of Earth, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. We present lightning distribution maps for Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, and flash densities for these planets and Venus, based on optical and/or radio measurements from the WWLLN and STARNET radio networks, the LIS/OTD satellite instruments, the Galileo, Cassini, New Horizons and Venus Express spacecraft. We also present flash densities calculated for several phases of two volcano eruptions, Eyjafjallaj$\backslash$"okull's (2010) and Mt Redoubt's (2009). We estimate lightning rates for sample, transiting and directly imaged extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Based on the large variety of exoplanets, six categories are suggested for which we use the lightning occurrence information from the Solar System. We examine lightning energy distributions for Earth, Jupiter and Saturn. We discuss how strong stellar activity may support lightning activity. We provide a lower limit of the total number of flashes that might occur on transiting planets during their full transit as input for future studies. We find that volcanically very active planets might show the largest lightning flash densities. When applying flash densities of the large Saturnian storm from 2010/11, we find that the exoplanet HD 189733b would produce high lightning occurrence even during its short transit.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of the first directly imaged, planetary-mass object, 2MASS 1207 b, several works have sought to explain a disparity between its observed temperature and luminosity. Given its known age, distance, and spectral type, 2MASS 1207 b is underluminous by a factor of ∼10 (∼2.5 mag) when compared to standard models of brown-dwarf/giant-planet evolution. In this paper, we study three possible sources of 2MASS 1207 b's underluminosity. First, we investigate Mohanty et al.'s hypothesis that a near edge-on disk, comprising large, gray-extincting grains, might be responsible for 2MASS 1207 b's underluminosity. After radiative transfer modeling, we conclude that the hypothesis is unlikely due to the lack of variability seen in multi-epoch photometry and unnecessary due to the increasing sample of underluminous brown dwarfs/giant exoplanets that cannot be explained by an edge-on disk. Next, we test the analogous possibility that a spherical shell of dust could explain 2MASS 1207 b's underluminosity. Models containing enough dust to create ∼2.5 mag of extinction, placed at reasonable radii, are ruled out by our new Gemini/T-ReCS 8.7 $\mu$m photometric upper limit for 2MASS 1207 b. Finally, we investigate the possibility that 2MASS 1207 b is intrinsically cooler than the commonly used AMES-DUSTY fits to its spectrum, and thus it is not, in fact, underluminous. New, thick-cloud model grids by Madhusudhan et al. fit 2MASS 1207 b's 1–10 $\mu$m spectral energy distribution well, but they do not quite fit its near-infrared spectrum. However, we suggest that with some " tuning, " they might be capable of simultaneously reproducing 2MASS 1207 b's spectral shape and luminosity. In this case, the whole class of young, underluminous brown dwarfs/giant exoplanets might be explained by atmospheres that are able to suspend thick, dusty clouds in their photospheres at temperatures lower than field brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {BANYAN$\Sigma$ is a new Bayesian algorithm to identify members of young stellar associations within 150 pc of the Sun. It includes 27 young associations with ages in the range ∼1-800 Myr, modeled with multivariate Gaussians in six-dimensional (6D) XYZUVW space. It is the first such multi-association classification tool to include the nearest subgroups of the Sco-Cen OB star-forming region, the IC2602, IC2391, Pleiades and Platais8 clusters, and the $\rho$Ophiuchi, Corona Australis, and Taurus star formation regions. A model of field stars is built from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians based on the Besan{\c{c}}on Galactic model. The algorithm can derive membership probabilities for objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion, but can also include parallax and radial velocity measurements, as well as spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in color-magnitude or spectral type-magnitude diagrams. BANYAN$\Sigma$ benefits from an analytical solution to the Bayesian marginalization integrals over unknown radial velocities and distances that makes it more accurate and significantly faster than its predecessor BANYANII. A contamination versus hit rate analysis is presented and demonstrates that BANYAN$\Sigma$ achieves a better classification performance than other moving group tools available in the literature, especially in terms of cross-contamination between young associations. An updated list of bona fide members in the 27 young associations, augmented by the Gaia-DR1 release, as well as all parameters for the 6D multivariate Gaussian models for each association and the Galactic field neighborhood within 300 pc are presented. This new tool will make it possible to analyze large data sets such as the upcoming Gaia-DR2 to identify new young stars. IDL and Python versions of BANYAN$\Sigma$ are made available with this publication, and a more limited online web tool is available at},

abstract = {The final stage of the accretion of Uranus and Neptune is numerically investigated. The four Jovian planets are considered with Jupiter and Saturn assumed to have reached their present sizes, whereas Uranus and Neptune are taken with initial masses 0.2 of their present ones. Allowance is made for the orbital variation of the Jovian planets due to the exchange of angular momentum with interacting bodies (“planetesimals”). Two possible effects that may have contributed to the accretion of Uranus and Neptune are incorporated in our model: (1) an enlarged cross section for accretion of incoming planetesimals due to the presence of extended gaseous envelopes and/or circumplanetary swarms of bodies; and (2) intermediate protoplanets in mid-range orbits between the Jovian planets. Significant radial displacements are found for Uranus and Neptune during their accretion and scattering of planetesimals. The orbital angular momentum budgets of Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn turn out to be positive; i.e., they on average gain orbital angular momentum in their interactions with planetesimals and hence they are displaced outwardly. Instead, Jupiter as the main ejector of bodies loses orbital angular momentum so it moves sunward. The gravitational stirring of planetesimals caused by the introduction of intermediate protoplanets has the effect that additional solid matter is injected into the accretion zones of Uranus and Neptune. For moderate enlargements of the radius of the accretion cross section (2–4 times), the accretion time scale of Uranus and Neptune are found to be a few 108 years and the initial amount of solid material required to form them of a few times their present masses. Given the crucial role played by the size of the accretion cross section, questions as to when Uranus and Neptune acquired their gaseous envelopes, when the envelopes collapsed onto the solid cores, and how massive they were are essential in defining the efficiency and time scale of accretion of the two outer Jovian planets.},

abstract = {We developed a simple, physical and self-consistent cloud model for brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. We compared different parametrisations for the cloud particle size, by either fixing particle radii, or fixing the mixing efficiency (parameter fsed) or estimating particle radii from simple microphysics. The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears as the best parametrisation by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra of brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. In particular, it reproduces the L-T transition, due to the condensation of silicate and iron clouds below the visible/near-IR photosphere. It also reproduces the reddening observed for low-gravity objects, due to an increase of cloud optical depth for low gravity. In addition, we found that the cloud greenhouse effect shifts chemical equilibriums, increasing the abundances of species stable at high temperature. This effect should significantly contribute to the strong variation of methane abundance at the L-T transition and to the methane depletion observed on young exoplanets. Finally, we predict the existence of a continuum of brown dwarfs and exoplanets for absolute J magnitude=15-18 and J-K color=0-3, due to the evolution of the L-T transition with gravity. This self-consistent model therefore provides a general framework to understand the effects of clouds and appears well-suited for atmospheric retrievals.},

The Sun turns out to be a common star that hosts planets, when considering its evolutionary stage.

abstract = {We have analysed 10 months of public data from the Kepler space mission to measure rotation periods of main-sequence stars with masses between 0.3 and 0.55 M⊙. To derive the rotational period, we introduce the autocorrelation function and show that it is robust against phase and amplitude modulation and residual instrumental systematics. Of the 2483 stars examined, we detected rotation periods in 1570 (63.2 per cent), representing an increase of a factor of ˜30 in the number of rotation period determination for field M dwarfs. The periods range from 0.37 to 69.7 d, with amplitudes ranging from 1.0 to 140.8 mmag. The rotation period distribution is clearly bimodal, with peaks at ˜19 and ˜33 d, hinting at two distinct waves of star formation, a hypothesis that is supported by the fact that slower rotators tend to have larger proper motions. The two peaks of the rotation period distribution form two distinct sequences in period-temperature space, with the period decreasing with increasing temperature, reminiscent of the Vaughan-Preston gap. The period-mass distribution of our sample shows no evidence of a transition at the fully convective boundary. On the other hand, the slope of the upper envelope of the period-mass relation changes sign around 0.55 M⊙, below which period rises with decreasing mass.},

Observations of 16 objects were obtained using eight echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.165Y1.323 m with NIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope. By comparing opacity plots and line lists, over 200 weak features in the J band are identified with either FeH or H 2 O transitions. Absorption by FeH attains maximum strength in the mid-L dwarfs, while H 2 O absorption becomes systematically stronger toward later spectral types. Narrow resolved features broaden markedly after the M to L transition. Our high-resolution spectra also reveal that the disappearance of neutral Al lines at the boundary between M and L dwarfs is remarkably abrupt, presumably because of the formation of grains. Neutral Fe lines can be traced to mid-L dwarfs before Fe is removed by condensation. The neutral potassium (K i) doublets that dominate the J band have pressure-broadened wings that continue to broaden from {\$}50 km s {\`{A}}1 (FWHM) at mid M to {\$}500 km s {\`{A}}1 at mid T. In contrast, however, the measured pseudoYequivalent widths of these same lines reach a maximum in the mid-L dwarfs. The young L2 dwarf, G196-3B, exhibits narrow potassium lines without extensive pressure-broadened wings, indicative of a lower gravity atmosphere. Kelu-1AB, another L2, has exceptionally broad infrared lines, including FeH and H 2 O features, confirming its status as a rapid rotator. In contrast to other late-T objects, the peculiar T6 dwarf 2MASS 0937+29 displays a complete absence of potassium even at high resolution, which may be a metallicity effect or a result of a cooler, higher gravity atmosphere.},

abstract = {Using the largest high-resolution spectroscopic sample to date of young, very low mass stars and brown dwarfs, we investigate disk accretion in objects ranging from just above the hydrogen-burning limit all the way to nearly planetary masses. Our 82 targets span spectral types from M5 to M9.5, or masses from 0.15 Msolar down to about 15 jupiters. They are confirmed members of the $\rho$ Ophiuchus, Taurus, Chamaeleon I, IC 348, R Coronae Australis, Upper Scorpius, and TW Hydrae star-forming regions and young clusters, with ages from {\textless}1 to {\~{}}10 Myr. The sample contains 41 brown dwarfs (spectral types {\textgreater}=M6.5). We have previously presented high-resolution optical spectra for roughly half the sample; the rest are new. This is a close to complete survey of all confirmed brown dwarfs known so far in the regions examined, except in $\rho$ Oph and IC 348 (where we are limited by a combination of extinction and distance). We find that (1) classical T Tauri-like disk accretion persists in the substellar domain down to nearly the deuterium-burning limit; (2) while an H$\alpha$ 10{\%} width {\textgreater}{\~{}}200 km s-1 is our prime accretion diagnostic (following our previous work), permitted emission lines of Ca II, O I, and He I are also good accretion indicators, just as in classical T Tauri stars (we caution against a blind use of H$\alpha$ width alone, since inclination and rotation effects on the line are especially important at the low accretion rates in very low mass objects); (3) the Ca II $\lambda$8662 line flux is an excellent quantitative measure of the accretion rate in very low mass stars and brown dwarfs (as in higher mass classical T Tauri Stars), correlating remarkably well with the M˙ obtained from veiling and H$\alpha$ modeling; (4) the accretion rate diminishes rapidly with mass-our measurements support previous suggestions that M˙{\~{}}M2* (albeit with considerable scatter) and extend this correlation to the entire range of substellar masses; (5) the fraction of very low mass stellar and substellar accretors decreases substantially with age, as in higher mass stars; (6) at any given age, the fraction of very low mass stellar and substellar accretors is comparable to the accretor fraction in higher mass stars; and (7) a number of our sources with infrared excesses arising from dusty disks do not evince measurable accretion signatures, with the incidence of such a mismatch increasing with age: this implies that disks in the low-mass regime can persist beyond the main accretion phase and parallels the transition from the classical to post-T Tauri stage in more massive stars. These strong similarities at young ages, between higher mass stars on the one hand and low-mass bodies close to and below the hydrogen-burning limit on the other, are consistent with a common formation mechanism in the two mass regimes.},

abstract = {We report on results of an observing campaign to support the Juno mission. At the beginning of 2016, using TEXES (Texas Echelon cross-dispersed Echelle Spectrograph), mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), we obtained data cubes of Jupiter in the 1930--1943 cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} spectral ranges (around 5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m), which probe the atmosphere in the 1--4 bar region, with a spectral resolution of {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 0.15 cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} and an angular resolution of {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 1.4". This dataset is analysed by a code that combines a line-by-line radiative transfer model with a non-linear optimal estimation inversion method. The inversion retrieves the vertical abundance profiles of NH{\$}{\_}3{\$} - which is the main contributor at these wavelengths - with a maximum sensitivity at {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 1--3 bar, as well as the cloud transmittance. This retrieval is performed on over more than one thousand pixels of our data cubes, producing maps of the disk, where all the major belts are visible. We present our retrieved NH{\$}{\_}3{\$} abundance maps which can be compared with the distribution observed by Juno's MWR (Bolton et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017) in the 2 bar region and discuss their significance for the understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics. We are able to show important latitudinal variations - such as in the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), where the NH{\$}{\_}3{\$} abundance is observed to drop down to 60 ppmv at 2 bar - as well as longitudinal variability. In the zones, we find the NH{\$}{\_}3{\$} abundance to increase with depth, from 100 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 15 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 30 ppmv at 3 bar. We also display the cloud transmittance--NH{\$}{\_}3{\$} abundance relationship, and find different behaviour for the NEB, the other belts and the zones. Using a simple cloud model, we are able to fit this relationship, at least in the NEB, including either NH{\$}{\_}3{\$}-ice or NH{\$}{\_}4{\$}SH particles with sizes between 10 and 100 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m.},

abstract = {Image persistence can produce systematic errors, which remain significant in some applications even when buried in noise. Ideally the image persistence amplitude, linearity and decay over time could be calibrated independently for each pixel to levels well below the noise floor, however averaging multiple measurements to characterize persistence to this accuracy is impractical due to the long time scales for the decay and the need to emulate the exposure and readout timing of the observations to be calibrated. We examine a compromise where the initial persistence response is characterized independently for each pixel but the latter parts of the decay are assumed to follow the mean decay curve. When averaged spatially, persistence increases monotonically with stimulus amplitude until the photodiodes approach forward bias. For several Teledyne 1.7 µm cutoff HgCdTe detectors tested, persistence is linear over most of the normal signal range. We characterize the temporal response, and examine the dependence of charge emission time constants on total stimulus duration. We describe the suppression of persistence by signal in the current frame and begin to examine the superposition of the decay curves from multiple stimuli. Keywords:,},

We report on reprocessing of all 40,000 beams with a number of algorithms, including conventional frequency-domain searches and an acceleration search for fast binary pulsars. The very large volume of results coupled with the need to distinguish new candidates from known pulsars and their many harmonics, often with multiple detections from different search algorithms, necessitated the development of a new graphical selection tool tightly linked to a web-based results database. We discuss and demonstrate the benefits of these software systems which are specifically designed for large survey projects. The results of this processing have been encouraging; we have discovered 128 new pulsars including 11 binary and 15 millisecond pulsars, in addition to those previously found in the survey, we have thus far discovered 737 pulsars. In this paper we discuss the discoveries of PSR J1744-3922, a 172 ms mildly recycled pulsar in a 4.6 hr orbit that exhibits nulling behaviour, not previously observed in recycled or binary objects; PSR J1802-2124, an intermediate mass binary pulsar (IMBP) and PSR J1801-1417, a solitary millisecond pulsar.},

abstract = {In addition to the transits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its star, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and its harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of starlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally distorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have also reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital frequency, as yet unexplained. Reflected phase variations of homogeneous planets only contain power at the orbital frequency and its even harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be produced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet with a north-south (N-S) asymmetric map. For tidally locked planets with thick atmospheres, either of these scenarios entail weather: planets with zero obliquity experience N-S symmetric stellar forcing. North-south asymmetry would therefore suggest stochastic localized features, i.e. weather. However, we find that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are artefacts of removing planetary transits rather than modelling them. The only reliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the third mode amplitude is 6-8 per cent of the planetary flux. Although time-variable albedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the infrared variability of other hot Jupiters make this scenario unlikely. We recommend further studying the tidal effects of close-in planets on their host stars, as this remains the only plausible hypothesis. The time-varying brightness of a planetary system reveals myriad details about the star and planets therein. Transits of a planet in front of its host star appear as regular dips in flux: the period of the transits corresponds to that of the planet and their depth is the cross-sectional size of the planet with respect to its host star; eclipses of the planet behind its host star appear as shallower dips, the depth of which indicates the brightness of the planet compared to that of its star. In addition to these relatively brief events, the time-resolved pho-tometry of a planetary system may also exhibit periodic, approximately sinusoidal, oscillations predominantly at the orbital frequency , n = 1, and twice this frequency, n = 2: phase variations due to reflected starlight and/or planetary emission produce variations at the orbital frequency of the planet with maximum flux near superior conjunction, while Doppler beaming of the starlight enhances the flux when the star is moving towards the observer (first quarter); ellipsoidal variations of the prolate planet and star cause maxima twice per orbit, at both quarter phases. 1 Many researchers have used the exquisite photometry of NASA's Kepler mission (Borucki 2016) to search for and measure the sinu-soidal phase variations of both transiting and non-transiting planetary systems. A few have reported significant power at higher order harmonics of the orbital frequency, in particular the n = 3 mode (three peaks and troughs per orbit).

abstract = {Context. Within the core accretion scenario of planetary formation, most simulations performed so far always assume the accreting envelope to have a solar composition. From the study of meteorite showers on Earth and numerical simulations, we know that planetesimals must undergo thermal ablation and disruption when crossing a protoplanetary envelope. Once the protoplanet has acquired an atmosphere, the primordial envelope gets enriched in volatiles and silicates from the planetesimals. This change of envelope composition during the formation can have a significant effect in the final atmospheric composition and on the formation timescale of giant planets. Aims. To investigate the physical implications of considering the envelope enrichment of protoplanets due to the disruption of icy planetesimals during their way to the core. Particular focus is placed on the effect on the critical core mass for envelopes where condensation of water can occur. Methods. Internal structure models are numerically solved with the implementation of updated opacities for all ranges of metallicities and the software CEA to compute the equation of state. CEA computes the chemical equilibrium for an arbitrary mixture of gases and allows the condensation of some species, including water. This means that the latent heat of phase transitions is consistently incorporated in the total energy budget. Results. The critical core mass is found to decrease significantly when an enriched envelope composition is considered in the internal structure equations. A particular strong reduction of the critical core mass is obtained for planets whose envelope metallicity is larger than Z=0.45 when the outer boundary conditions are suitable for condensation of water to occur in the top layers of the atmosphere. We show that this effect is qualitatively preserved when the atmosphere is out of chemical equilibrium.},

abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has a goal of detecting small planets orbiting stars bright enough for mass determination via ground-based radial velocity observations. Here we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-min cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250+/-70 exoplanets (90{\%} confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 Earth-radii. Furthermore, we predict an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M-dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 Earth-radii with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.},

abstract = {We report the analysis of two new spectroscopic observations in the near-infrared of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e, obtained with the WFC3 camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope. 55 Cancri e orbits so close to its parent star that temperatures much higher than 2000 K are expected on its surface. Given the brightness of 55 Cancri, the observations were obtained in scanning mode, adopting a very long scanning length and a very high scanning speed. We use our specialized pipeline to take into account systematics introduced by these observational parameters when coupled with the geometrical distortions of the instrument. We measure the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average relative uncertainty of 22 ppm per visit and find modulations that depart from a straight line model with a 6$\sigma$ confidence level. These results suggest that 55 Cancri e is surrounded by an atmosphere, which is probably hydrogen-rich. Our fully Bayesian spectral retrieval code,  -REx, has identified HCN to be the most likely molecular candidate able to explain the features at 1.42 and 1.54 $\mu$m. While additional spectroscopic observations in a broader wavelength range in the infrared will be needed to confirm the HCN detection, we discuss here the implications of such a result. Our chemical model, developed with combustion specialists, indicates that relatively high mixing ratios of HCN may be caused by a high C/O ratio. This result suggests this super-Earth is a carbon-rich environment even more exotic than previously thought.},

The entire variety of objects related to the various stages of early stellar evolution are represented in Lupus, including some of the best studied T Tauri stars like RU Lup. The determination of many properties of the clouds, as well as their associated stellar population, are limited by the uncertainty with which the distance is known. We argue that a single value of the distance is probably inadequate to be representative of the entire complex, and that depth effects are likely to be significant, as expected from its large extent on the plane of the sky. The total mass of molecular gas in the complex is a few times 10{\^{}}4 M{\_}⊙. The most distinctive property of its stellar population is the outstanding abundance of mid M-type pre-main sequence stars. Some likely substellar objects have been identified as well, particularly thanks to mid-infrared observations carried out with the Spitzer Space Observatory. A widely distributed young low-mass population of weak-line T Tauri stars, identified by its X-ray emission, is observed in the direction of Lupus but it is probably related to the Gould Belt rather than to the star forming complex. A few individual objects of particular interest are briefly reviewed: the Herbig Ae/Be stars HR 5999 and HR 6000 that dominate the Lupus 3 cloud, the classical T Tauri star RU Lup, the EXor class prototype EX Lup, the very low luminosity, outflow-driving sources HH 55 and Par-Lup3-4, the extreme emission-line star Th 28, and the binary object GQ Lup composed of an ordinary T Tauri star with a substellar companion of possible planetary mass.},

abstract = {We present 50 nights of polarimetric observations of HD 189733 in {\$}B{\$} band using the POLISH2 aperture-integrated polarimeter at the Lick Observatory Shane 3-m telescope. This instrument, commissioned in 2011, is designed to search for Rayleigh scattering from short-period exoplanets due to the polarized nature of scattered light. Since these planets are spatially unresolvable from their host stars, the relative contribution of the planet-to-total system polarization is expected to vary with an amplitude of order 10 parts per million (ppm) over the course of the orbit. Non-zero and also variable at the 10 ppm level, the inherent polarization of the Lick 3-m telescope limits the accuracy of our measurements and currently inhibits conclusive detection of scattered light from this exoplanet. However, the amplitude of observed variability conservatively sets a {\$}3 \backslashsigma{\$} upper limit to the planet-induced polarization of the system of 58 ppm in {\$}B{\$} band, which is consistent with a previous upper limit from the POLISH instrument at the Palomar Observatory 5-m telescope (Wiktorowicz 2009). A physically-motivated Rayleigh scattering model, which includes the depolarizing effects of multiple scattering, is used to conservatively set a {\$}3 \backslashsigma{\$} upper limit to the geometric albedo of HD 189733b of {\$}A{\_}g {\textless} 0.37{\$}. This value is consistent with the value {\$}A{\_}g = 0.226 \backslashpm 0.091{\$} derived from occultation observations with HST STIS (Evans et al. 2013), but it is inconsistent with the large {\$}A{\_}g = 0.61 \backslashpm 0.12{\$} albedo reported by (Berdyugina et al. 2011).},

abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy provides a window to study exoplanetary atmospheres, but that window is fogged by clouds and hazes. Clouds and haze introduce a degeneracy between the strength of gaseous absorption features and planetary physical parameters such as abundances. One way to break that degeneracy is via statistical studies. We collect all published HST/WFC3 transit spectra for 1.1-1.65 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m water vapor absorption, and perform a statistical study on potential correlations between the water absorption feature and planetary parameters. We fit the observed spectra with a template calculated for each planet using the Exo-Transmit code. We express the magnitude of the water absorption in scale heights, thereby removing the known dependence on temperature, surface gravity, and mean molecular weight. We find that the absorption in scale heights has a positive baseline correlation with planetary equilibrium temperature; our hypothesis is that decreasing cloud condensation with increasing temperature is responsible for this baseline slope. However, the observed sample is also intrinsically degenerate in the sense that equilibrium temperature correlates with planetary mass. We compile the distribution of absorption in scale heights, and we find that this distribution is closer to log-normal than Gaussian. However, we also find that the distribution of equilibrium temperatures for the observed planets is similarly log-normal. This indicates that the absorption values are affected by observational bias, whereby observers have not yet targeted a sufficient sample of the hottest planets.},

abstract = {The field of exoplanetary science has seen discovery rates increase dramatically over recent years, due largely to the data from the Kepler mission. Even so, individual discoveries of planets orbiting nearby stars are very important for studies of characterization and near-term follow-up prospects. The recent discovery of a terrestrial planet candidate orbiting Proxima Centauri presents numerous opportunities for studying a Super-Earth within our own stellar backyard. One of the remaining ambiguities of the discovery is the true mass of the planet since the discovery signature was obtained via radial velocities. Here we describe the effect of orbital inclination on the Proxima Centauri planet, in terms of mass, radius, atmosphere, and albedo. We calculate the astrometric, angular separation, and reflected light properties of the planet including the effects of orbital eccentricity. We further provide dynamical simulations that show how the presence of additional terrestrial planets within the Habitable Zone varies as a function of inclination. Finally, we discuss these effects in the context of future space-based photometry and imaging missions that could potentially detect the planetary signature and resolve the inclination and mass ambiguity of the planet.},

abstract = {Proxima Centauri has become the subject of intense study since the radial-velocity discovery by Anglada-Escud$\backslash$'e et al. 2016 of a planet orbiting this nearby M-dwarf every {\~{}} 11.2 days. If Proxima Centauri b transits its host star, independent confirmation of its existence is possible, and its mass and radius can be measured in units of the stellar host mass and radius. To date, there have been three independent claims of possible transit-like event detections in light curve observations obtained by the MOST satellite (in 2014-15), the BSST telescope in Antarctica (in 2016), and the Las Campanas Observatory (in 2016). The claimed possible detections are tentative, due in part to the variability intrinsic to the host star, and in the case of the ground-based observations, also due to the limited duration of the light curve observations. Here, we present preliminary results from an extensive photometric monitoring campaign of Proxima Centauri, using telescopes around the globe and spanning from 2006 to 2017, comprising a total of 329 observations. Considering our data that coincide directly and/or phased with the previously published tentative transit detections, we are unable to independently verify those claims. We do, however, verify the previously reported ubiquitous and complex variability of the host star. We discuss possible interpretations of the data in light of the previous claims, and we discuss future analyses of these data that could more definitively verify or refute the presence of transits associated with the radial-velocity discovered planet.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We have only been able to comprehensively characterize the atmospheres of a handful of transiting planets, because most orbit faint stars. TESS will discover transiting planets orbiting the brightest stars, enabling, in principle, an atmospheric survey of 10{\^{}}2 to 10{\^{}}3 bright hot Jupiters and warm sub-Neptunes. Uniform observations of such a statistically significant sample would provide leverage to understand---and learn from---the diversity of short-period planets. We argue that the best way to maximize the scientific returns of TESS is with a follow-up space mission consisting of a {\~{}}1 m telescope with an optical--NIR spectrograph: it could measure molecular absorption for non-terrestrial planets, as well as eclipses and phase variations for the hottest jovians. Such a mission could observe up to 10{\^{}}3 transits per year, thus enabling it to survey a large fraction of the bright (J{\textless}11) TESS planets. JWST could be used to perform detailed atmospheric characterization of the most interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse, and---when possible---phase-resolved spectroscopy). TESS is also expected to discover a few temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby M-Dwarfs. Characterizing these worlds will be time-intensive: JWST will need months to provide tantalizing constraints on the presence of an atmosphere, planetary rotational state, clouds, and greenhouse gases. Future flagship missions should be designed to provide better constraints on the habitability of M-Dwarf temperate terrestrial planets.},

abstract = {We present observations of WASP-63b by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as part of "A Preparatory Program to Identify the Single Best Transiting Exoplanet for JWST Early Release Science". WASP-63b is one of the community targets under consideration for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Early Release Science (ERS) program. We present a spectrum derived from a single observation by HST Wide Field Camera 3 in the near infrared. We engaged groups across the transiting exoplanet community to participate in the analysis of the data and present results from each. There is general agreement amongst all results that we find an H2O absorption feature with 3.5-4.0 sigma significance. However, the feature is muted in comparison to a clear atmosphere at solar composition. Although the detection of the water feature is robust, the reasons for the muting of this feature are ambiguous due to a degeneracy between clouds and composition. The data does not yield robust detections of any molecular species other than H2O. The group was motivated to perform an additional set of retrieval exercises to investigate an apparent bump in the spectrum at {\~{}} 1.55 um. We explore possible disequilibrium chemistry and find this feature is consistent with super-solar HCN abundance but it is questionable if the required mixing ratio of HCN is chemically and physically plausible. The ultimate goal of this study is to vet WASP-63b as a potential community target to best demonstrate the capabilities and systematics of JWST instruments for transiting exoplanet science. In the case of WASP-63b, the presence of a detectable water feature indicates that WASP-63b remains a plausible target for ERS observations.},

abstract = {A new class of exoplanets has emerged: the ultra hot Jupiters, the hottest close-in gas giants. Most of them have weaker than expected spectral features in the {\$}1.1-1.7\backslashmu m{\$} bandpass probed by HST/WFC3 but stronger spectral features at longer wavelengths probed by Spitzer. This led previous authors to puzzling conclusions about the thermal structures and chemical abundances of these planets. Using the SPARC/MITgcm, we investigate how thermal dissociation, ionization, H{\$}{\^{}}-{\$} opacity and clouds shape the thermal structures and spectral properties of ultra hot Jupiters with a special focus on WASP-121b. We expand our findings to the whole population of ultra hot Jupiters through analytical quantification of the thermal dissociation and its influence on the strength of spectral features. We predict that most molecules are thermally dissociated and alkalies are ionized in the dayside photospheres of ultra hot Jupiters. This includes H{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 2{\}}{\$}O, TiO, VO, and H{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 2{\}}{\$} but not CO, which has a stronger molecular bond. The vertical molecular gradient created by the dissociation significantly weakens the spectral features from water while the {\$}4.5\backslashmu m{\$} CO feature remain unchanged. The water band in the HST/WFC3 bandpass is further weakened by H{\$}{\^{}}-{\$} continuum opacity. Molecules are expected to recombine before reaching the limb, leading to order of magnitude variations of the chemical composition and cloud coverage between the limb and the dayside. Overall, molecular dissociation provides a qualitative understanding of the lack of strong spectral feature of water in the {\$}1-2\backslashmu m{\$} bandpass observed in most ultra hot Jupiters. Quantitatively, however, our model does not provide a satisfactory match to the WASP-121b emission spectrum. Together with WASP-33b and Kepler-33Ab, they seem the outliers among the population of ultra hot Jupiters in need of a more thorough understanding.},

The role of H-
Largest absorber below 1micron after TiO/VO

abstract = {Hot Jupiters are giant Jupiter-like exoplanets that orbit 100x closer to their host stars than Jupiter does to the Sun. These planets presumably form in the outer part of the primordial disc from which both the central star and surrounding planets are born, then migrate inwards and yet avoid falling into their host star. It is however unclear whether this occurs early in the lives of hot Jupiters, when still embedded within protoplanetary discs, or later, once multiple planets are formed and interact. Although numerous hot Jupiters were detected around mature Sun-like stars, their existence has not yet been firmly demonstrated for young stars, whose magnetic activity is so intense that it overshadows the radial velocity signal that close-in giant planets can induce. Here we show that hot Jupiters around young stars can be revealed from extended sets of high-resolution spectra. Once filtered-out from the activity, radial velocities of V830 Tau derived from new data collected in late 2015 exhibit a sine wave of period 4.93 d and semi-amplitude 75 m/ s, detected with a false alarm probability {\textless}0.03{\%}. We find that this signal is fully unrelated to the 2.741-d rotation period of V830 Tau and we attribute it to the presence of a 0.77 Jupiter mass planet orbiting at a distance of 0.057 au from the host star. Our result demonstrates that hot Jupiters can migrate inwards in {\textless}2 Myr, most likely as a result of planet-disc interactions, and thus yields strong support to the theory of giant planet migration in gaseous protoplanetary discs.},

From low-resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy we classified the primary and the companion as an M7.5+/-0.5 and L7+/-1.5, respectively. The primary shows weaker alkali lines than field dwarfs of similar spectral type, but still consistent with either a high-gravity dwarf or a younger object of hundreds of millions of years. The secondary shows spectral features characteristic for low surface gravity objects at ages below several hundred Myr, like the triangular shape of the H-band continuum and alkali lines weaker than in field dwarfs of the same spectral type. The absence of lithium in the atmosphere of the primary and the likely membership to the Local Association allowed us to constrain the age of the system to the range of 150-300 Myr. We report a measurement of the trigonometric parallax pi=78.8+/-6.4 mas, which translates into a distance of 12.7+/-1.0 pc; the pair thus has a projected physical separation of 102+/-9 AU. We derived the Lbol of the components and compared them with theoretical evolutionary models to estimate the masses and effective temperatures. For the primary, we determined log(Lbol/LSun)=-3.14+/-0.10, and a mass of 73 (+20,-15{\}} MJup at the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs and Teff of 2620+/-140 K.

abstract = {With the increasing number of directly imaged giant exoplanets, the current atmosphere models are often not capable of fully explaining the spectra and luminosity of the sources. A particularly challenging component of the atmosphere models is the formation and properties of condensate cloud layers, which fundamentally impact the energetics, opacity, and evolution of the planets. Here we present a suite of techniques that can be used to estimate the level of rotational modulations these planets may show. We propose that the time-resolved observations of such periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations of extrasolar planets due to their rotation can be used as a powerful tool to probe the heterogeneity of their optical surfaces. In this paper, we develop simulations to explore the capabilities of current and next-generation ground-and space-based instruments for this technique. We address and discuss the following questions: (1) what planet properties can be deduced from the light curve and/or spectra, and in particular can we determine rotation periods, spot coverage, spot colors, and spot spectra?; (2) what is the optimal configuration of instrument/wavelength/temporal sampling required for these measurements?; and (3) can principal component analysis be used to invert the light curve and deduce the surface map of the planet? Our simulations describe the expected spectral differences between homogeneous (clear or cloudy) and patchy atmospheres, outline the significance of the dominant absorption features of H 2 O, CH 4 , and CO, and provide a method to distinguish these two types of atmospheres. Assuming surfaces with and without clouds for most currently imaged planets the current models predict the largest variations in the J band. Simulated photometry from current and future instruments is used to estimate the level of detectable photometric variations. We conclude that future instruments will be able to recover not only the rotation periods, cloud cover, cloud colors, and spectra but even cloud evolution. We also show that a longitudinal map of the planet's atmosphere can be deduced from its disk-integrated light curves.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on the W. M. Keck I Telescope of seven low-mass T Tauri stars (LMTTs) and brown dwarfs in Taurus-Auriga. The observed Li I 6708 {\AA} absorption, low surface gravity signatures, and radial velocities confirm that all are members of the Taurus star-forming region; no new spectroscopic binaries are identified. Four of the seven targets observed appear to be T Tauri brown dwarfs. Of particular interest is the previously classified ``continuum T Tauri star'' GM Tau, which has a spectral type of M6.5 and possibly a substellar mass. These spectra, in combination with previous high-resolution spectra of LMTTs, are used to understand the formation and early evolution of objects in Taurus-Auriga with masses near and below the stellar/substellar boundary. None of the LMTTs in Taurus are rapidly rotating (vsini{\textless}30 km s-1), unlike low-mass objects in Orion. Many of the slowly rotating, nonaccreting stars and brown dwarfs exhibit prominent H$\alpha$ emission (equivalent widths of 3-36 {\AA}), indicative of active chromospheres. We demonstrate empirically that the full width at 10{\%} of the H$\alpha$ emission profile peak is a more practical and possibly more accurate indicator of accretion than either the equivalent width of H$\alpha$ or optical veiling: 10{\%} widths {\textgreater}270 km s-1 are classical T Tauri stars (i.e., accreting), independent of stellar spectral type. Although LMTTs can have accretion rates comparable to that of more typical, higher mass T Tauri stars (e.g., K7-M0 spectral types), the average mass accretion rate appears to decrease with decreasing mass. A functional form of M{\~{}}M is consistent with the available data, but the dependence is difficult to establish because of both selection biases in observed samples and the decreasing frequency of active accretion disks at low masses (M{\textless}0.2 Msolar). The diminished frequency of accretion disks for LMTTs, in conjunction with their lower, on average, mass accretion rates, implies that they are formed with less massive disks than higher mass T Tauri stars. The radial velocities, circumstellar properties, and known binaries do not support the suggestion that many of the lowest mass members of Taurus have been ejected from higher stellar density regions within the cloud. Instead, LMTTs appear to have formed and are evolving in the same way as higher mass T Tauri stars, but with smaller disks and shorter disk lifetimes.},

abstract = {The computation of transmission spectra is a central ingredient in the study of exo-planetary atmospheres. First, we revisit the theory of transmission spectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission spectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a reference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We show that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius, the assumed value of the reference pressure (typ-ically set to 10 bar) and the inferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC3 transmission spectrum. Second, we demonstrate that transmission spectra may be assumed to be isobaric, which simplifies the data analysis. We validate the isothermal, isobaric analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full nu-merical calculations and show that the typical errors are ∼ 0.1{\%} (∼ 10 ppm) within the WFC3 range of wavelengths. Third, we generalize the previous formula for the transit radius to include a small temperature gradient. Finally, we analyze the mea-sured WFC3 transmission spectrum of WASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the retrieval approach of Kreidberg et al. (2015) if the reference transit radius and reference pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown func-tional relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure implies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure that is being re-trieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone. This degeneracy leads to a fundamental limitation on how accurately we may extract molecular abundances from transmission spectra. We suggest an approximate expression for this relationship.},

abstract = {Here we present additional photometry of targets observed as part of the Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 Test of Surfaces in the Outer Solar System. 12 targets were re-observed with the Wide Field Camera 3 in optical and NIR wavebands designed to compliment those used during the first visit. Additionally, all observations originally presented by Fraser and Brown (2012) were reanalyzed through the same updated photometry pipeline. A reanalysis of the optical and NIR colour distribution reveals a bifurcated optical colour distribution and only two identifiable spectral classes, each of which occupies a broad range of colours and have correlated optical and NIR colours, in agreement with our previous findings. We report the detection of significant spectral variations on 5 targets which cannot be attributed to photometry errors, cosmic rays, point spread function or sensitivity variations, or other image artifacts capable of explaining the magnitude of the variation. The spectrally variable objects are found to have a broad range of dynamical classes, absolute magnitudes, exhibit a broad range of apparent magnitude variations, and are found in both compositional classes. The spectrally variable objects with sufficiently accurate colours for spectral classification maintain their membership, belonging to the same class at both epochs. 2005 TV189 exhibits a sufficiently broad difference in colour at the two epochs that span the full range of colours of the neutral class. This strongly argues that the neutral class is one single class with a broad range of colours, rather than the combination of multiple overlapping classes.},

abstract = {The re-emergence of the 0.99 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m FeH feature in brown dwarfs of early- to mid-T spectral type has been suggested as evidence for cloud disruption where flux from deep, hot regions below the Fe cloud deck can emerge. The same mechanism could account for color changes at the L/T transition and photometric variability. We present the first observations of spectroscopic variability of brown dwarfs covering the 0.99 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m FeH feature. We observed the spatially resolved very nearby brown dwarf binary WISE J104915.57-531906.1 (Luhman 16AB), a late-L and early-T dwarf, with HST/WFC3 in the G102 grism at 0.8-1.15 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. We find significant variability at all wavelengths for both brown dwarfs, with peak-to-valley amplitudes of 9.3{\%} for Luhman 16B and 4.5{\%} for Luhman 16A. This represents the first unambiguous detection of variability in Luhman 16A. We estimate a rotational period between 4.5 and 5.5 h, very similar to Luhman 16B. Variability in both components complicates the interpretation of spatially unresolved observations. The probability for finding large amplitude variability in any two brown dwarfs is less than 10{\%}. Our finding may suggest that a common but yet unknown feature of the binary is important for the occurrence of variability. For both objects, the amplitude is nearly constant at all wavelengths except in the deep K I feature below 0.84 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. No variations are seen across the 0.99 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m FeH feature. The observations lend strong further support to cloud height variations rather than holes in the silicate clouds, but cannot fully rule out holes in the iron clouds. We re-evaluate the diagnostic potential of the FeH feature as a tracer of cloud patchiness.},

The periods range from a few hours to two days (plus one outlier at five days), with a median just above one day, confirming that brown dwarfs, except at the very youngest ages, are fast rotators. Interestingly, four of the slowest rotators in our sample exhibit mid-infrared excess emission from disks; at least two also show signs of disk eclipses and accretion in the light curves. Comparing these new periods with those for two other young clusters and simple angular momentum evolution tracks, we find little or no rotational braking in brown dwarfs between 1–10 Myr, in contrast to low-mass stars. Our findings show that disk braking, while still at work, is inefficient in the substellar regime, thus providing an important constraint on the mass dependence of the braking mechanism.},

abstract = {WASP-80b is a missing link in the study of exo-atmospheres. It falls between the warm Neptunes and the hot Jupiters and is amenable for characterisation, thanks to its host star's properties. We observed the planet through transit and during occultation with Warm Spitzer. Combining our mid-infrared transits with optical time series, we find that the planet presents a transmission spectrum indistinguishable from a horizontal line. In emission, WASP-80b is the intrinsically faintest planet whose dayside flux has been detected in both the 3.6 and 4.5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m Spitzer channels. The depths of the occultations reveal that WASP-80b is as bright and as red as a T4 dwarf, but that its temperature is cooler. If planets go through the equivalent of an L-T transition, our results would imply this happens at cooler temperatures than for brown dwarfs. Placing WASP-80b's dayside into a colour-magnitude diagram, it falls exactly at the junction between a blackbody model and the T-dwarf sequence; we cannot discern which of those two interpretations is the more likely. Flux measurements on other planets with similar equilibrium temperatures are required to establish whether irradiated gas giants, like brown dwarfs, transition between two spectral classes. An eventual detection of methane absorption in transmission would also help lift that degeneracy. We obtained a second series of high-resolution spectra during transit, using HARPS. We reanalyse the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The data now favour an aligned orbital solution and a stellar rotation nearly three times slower than stellar line broadening implies. A contribution to stellar line broadening, maybe macroturbulence, is likely to have been underestimated for cool stars, whose rotations have therefore been systematically overestimated. [abridged]},

We find a significant correlation between the sizes and luminosities, such that {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} \backslashpropto L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm mm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}0.5{\}}{\$}, providing a confirmation and quantitative characterization of a putative trend that was noted previously. This correlation suggests that these disks have roughly the same average surface brightness interior to their given effective radius, {\~{}}0.2 Jy arcsec{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} (or 8 K in brightness temperature). The same trend remains, but the 0.2dex of dispersion perpendicular to this relation essentially disappears, when we account for the irradiation environment of each disk with a crude approximation of the dust temperatures based on the stellar host luminosities. We consider two (not mutually exclusive) explanations for the origin of this size-luminosity relationship. Simple models of the growth and migration of disk solids can account for the observed trend for a reasonable range of initial conditions, but only on timescales that are much shorter than the nominal ages present in the sample. An alternative scenario invokes optically thick emission concentrated on unresolved scales, with filling factors of a few tens of percent, that are perhaps manifestations of localized particle traps.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}At about 1000 days after the launch of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}we present the first {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}data release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}A summary of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The raw data collected by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Tycho{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-2 catalogues – a realisation of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Tycho{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-{\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Astrometric Solution (TGAS) – and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band magnitudes for all sources. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band light curves and the characteristics of {\~{}}3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for the proper motions. A systematic component of {\~{}}0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of {\~{}}94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is {\~{}}10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to {\~{}}0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia {\textless}i/{\textgreater}data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

abstract = {Ages and masses of young stars are often estimated by comparing their luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main sequence stellar evolution tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots complicate both the observations and evolution. To understand their influence, we study the heavily-spotted weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of radiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new methodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot temperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed from Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum. Clearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric component {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}hot{\}}{\}} \backslashsim4100{\$} K and to a cool component {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}cool{\}}{\}} \backslashsim2700-3000{\$} K, which covers {\$}\backslashsim80\backslash{\%}{\$} of the visible surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the spectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band strengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy. Although the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear much younger and lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar evolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and adoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict most fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions starspots act as a featureless veiling continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy line-blanketing in cool star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an anti-correlation between the velocities of the warm and cool components.},

abstract = {The study of dynamical processes in protoplanetary disks is essential to understand planet formation. In this context, transition disks are prime targets because they are at an advanced stage of disk clearing and may harbor direct signatures of disk evolution. In this paper, we aim to derive new constraints on the structure of the transition disk MWC 758, to detect non-axisymmetric features and understand their origin. We obtained infrared polarized intensity observations of the protoplanetary disk MWC 758 with SPHERE/VLT at 1.04 microns to resolve scattered light at a smaller inner working angle (0.093") and a higher angular resolution (0.027") than previously achieved. We observe polarized scattered light within 0.53" (148 au) down to the inner working angle (26 au) and detect distinct non-axisymmetric features but no fully depleted cavity. The two small-scale spiral features that were previously detected with HiCIAO are resolved more clearly, and new features are identified, including two that are located at previously inaccessible radii close to the star. We present a model based on the spiral density wave theory with two planetary companions in circular orbits. The best model requires a high disk aspect ratio (H/r{\~{}}0.20 at the planet locations) to account for the large pitch angles which implies a very warm disk. Our observations reveal the complex morphology of the disk MWC758. To understand the origin of the detected features, the combination of high-resolution observations in the submillimeter with ALMA and detailed modeling is needed.},

abstract = {Growing observational evidence has suggested active meteorology in atmospheres of brown dwarfs (BDs) and directly imaged extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-IR brightness variability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite initial understandings of atmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous studies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to seek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the thermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via large opacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this work, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a self-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing, cloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show that radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in both temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and directly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are one to tens of hours with typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of Kelvins in effective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range of parameter space, but the detailed evolution of variability is sensitive to model parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important implications for the observed flux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs, especially those evolve in short timescales. It is also a promising mechanism for cloud breaking, which has been proposed to explain the L/T transition of brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor exo-planets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the transits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its star, researchers have re-ported flux variations at the orbital frequency and its harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of starlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally distorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have also reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital frequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal the-ory. The reflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even orbital harmonics—important for studies of ellipsoidal variations—but cannot con-tain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be produced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet with a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail weather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S symmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would therefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we find that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are artifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only reliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the third mode amplitude is 6–8{\%} of the planetary flux. Although time-variable albedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the infrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely. We urge theorists to study the effects of close-in planets on stellar atmospheres, as this remains the only plausible hypothesis.},

abstract = {Planet formation theories predict a large but still undetected population of short-period terrestrial planets orbiting brown dwarfs. Should specimens of this population be discovered transiting relatively bright and nearby brown dwarfs, the Jupiter-size and the low luminosity of their hosts would make them exquisite targets for detailed atmospheric characterisation with JWST and future ground-based facilities. The eventual discovery and detailed study of a significant sample of transiting terrestrial planets orbiting nearby brown dwarfs could prove to be useful not only for comparative exoplanetology but also for astrobiology, by bringing us key information on the physical requirements and timescale for the emergence of life. In this context, we present a search for transit-signals in archival time-series photometry acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope for a sample of 44 nearby brown dwarfs. While these 44 targets were not particularly selected for their brightness, the high precision of their Spitzer light curves allows us to reach sensitivities below Earth-sized planets for 75{\%} of the sample and down to Europa-sized planets on the brighter targets. We could not identify any unambiguous planetary signal. Instead, we could compute the first limits on the presence of planets on close-in orbits.

abstract = {Condensation clouds in substellar atmospheres have been widely inferred from spectra and photometric variability. Up until now, their horizontally averaged vertical distribution and mean particle size have been largely characterized using models, one of which is the eddy diffusion–sedimentation model from Ackerman {\&} Marley (2001) that relies on a sedimentation efficiency parameter, f sed , to determine the vertical extent of clouds in the atmosphere. However, the physical processes controlling the vertical structure of clouds in substellar atmospheres are not well understood. In this work, we derive trends in f sed across a large range of eddy diffusivities (K zz), gravities, material properties, and cloud formation pathways by fitting cloud distributions calculated by a more detailed cloud microphysics model. We find that f sed is dependent on K zz , but not gravity, when K zz is held constant. f sed is most sensitive to the nucleation rate of cloud particles, as determined by material properties like surface energy and molecular weight. High surface energy materials form fewer, larger cloud particles, leading to large f sed ({\textgreater}1), and vice versa for materials with low surface energy. For cloud formation via heterogeneous nucleation, f sed is sensitive to the condensation nuclei flux and radius, connecting cloud formation in substellar atmospheres to the objects' formation environments and other atmospheric aerosols. These insights could lead to improved cloud models that help us better understand substellar atmospheres. For example, we demonstrate that f sed could increase with increasing cloud base depth in an atmosphere, shedding light on the nature of the brown dwarf L/T transition.},

Therefore, the suggested circumplanetary disk of Kalas and co-workers might not contain much material, or might be closer to face-on. Finally, we suggest that the widest (a  100 AU) low mass ratio (M p /M {\aa} ≡ q  0.01) companions may have formed inside protoplanetary disks but were later scattered by binary/planet interactions.

abstract = {The atmospheres of substellar objects contain clouds of oxides, iron, silicates and other refractory condensates. Water clouds are expected in the coolest objects. The opacity of these `dust' clouds strongly affects both the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile and the emergent flux. Thus, any attempt to model the spectra of these atmospheres must incorporate a cloud model. However, the diversity of cloud models in atmospheric simulations is large and it is not always clear how the underlying physics of the various models compare. Likewise, the observational consequences of different modelling approaches can be masked by other model differences, making objective comparisons challenging. In order to clarify the current state of the modelling approaches, this paper compares five different cloud models in two sets of tests. Test case 1 tests the dust cloud models for a prescribed L-, L-T and T-dwarf atmospheric (temperature T, pressure p, convective velocity vconv) structures. Test case 2 compares complete model atmosphere results for given (effective temperature Teff, surface gravity logg). All models agree on the global cloud structure but differ in opacity relevant details such as grain size, amount of dust, dust and gas-phase composition. These models can loosely be grouped into high- and low-altitude cloud models whereas the first appears generally redder in near-infrared colours than the latter. Comparisons of synthetic photometric fluxes translate into a modelling uncertainty in apparent magnitudes for our L-dwarf (T-dwarf) test case of 0.25 {\textless}{\~{}} $\Delta$m {\textless}{\~{}} 0.875 (0.1 {\textless}{\~{}} $\Delta$m {\textless}{\~{}} 1.375), taking into account the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, the UKIRT WFCAM, the Spitzer IRAC and VLT VISIR filters with UKIRT WFCAM being the most challenging for the models. Future developments will need closer links with laboratory astrophysics, and a consistent treatment of the cloud chemistry and turbulence.},

We apply the model to Earth-analogs around stars of different masses by incorporating the constraints on habitability set by stellar physics including the habitable zone lifetime, availability of ultraviolet radiation for prebiotic chemistry, and atmospheric escape. The critical step model suggests that the habitability of Earth-analogs around M-dwarfs is significantly suppressed. The total number of stars with planets containing detectable biosignatures of microbial life is expected to be highest for K-dwarfs. In contrast, we find that the corresponding value for intelligent life (technosignatures) should be highest for solar-mass stars. Thus, our work may assist in the identification of suitable targets in the search for biosignatures and technosignatures.},

Radial velocity observations indicate it hosts a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of approximately 9 days. In this work, we analyze time series of CI Tau's photometric variability as seen by K2. The lightcurve reveals the stellar rotation period to be {\~{}}6.6 d. Although there is no evidence that CI Tau b transits the host star, a {\~{}}9 d signature is also present in the lightcurve.

abstract = {Gas-giant planets that form via core accretion might have very different characteristics from those that form via disk instability. Disk-instability objects are typically thought to have higher entropies, larger radii, and (generally) higher effective temperatures than core-accretion objects. In this paper, we provide a large set of models exploring the observational consequences of high-entropy (hot) and low-entropy (cold) initial conditions, in the hope that this will ultimately help to distinguish between different physical mechanisms of planet formation. However, the exact entropies and radii of newly formed planets due to these two modes of formation cannot, at present, be precisely predicted. It is possible that the distribution of properties of core-accretion-formed planets and the distribution of properties of disk-instability-formed planets overlap. We, therefore, introduce a broad range of "warm-start" gas-giant planet models. Between the hottest and the coldest models that we consider, differences in radii, temperatures, luminosities, and spectra persist for only a few million to a few tens of millions of years for planets that are a few times Jupiter's mass or less. For planets that are {\~{}}five times Jupiter's mass or more, significant differences between hottest-start and coldest-start models persist for on the order of 100 Myr. We find that out of the standard infrared bands (J, H, K, L', M, N) the K and H bands are the most diagnostic of the initial conditions. A hottest-start model can be from {\~{}}4.5 mag brighter (at Jupiter's mass) to {\~{}}9 mag brighter (at 10 times Jupiter's mass) than a coldest-start model in the first few million years. In more massive objects, these large differences in luminosity and spectrum persist for much longer than in less massive objects. Finally, we consider the influence of atmospheric conditions on spectra, and find that the presence or absence of clouds, and the metallicity of an atmosphere, can affect an object's apparent brightness in different bands by up to several magnitudes.},

abstract = {We present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from the Planck full mission data set. Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise of six, and is more than a factor of two larger than the 2013 Planck cluster cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, {\$}1-b{\$}. In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck clusters as a third independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those coming from Planck analysis of primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of {\$}1-b{\$} the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while for the largest estimated value it remains substantial. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat {\$}\backslashLambda CDM{\$} model by combining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10{\%}-level to 1{\%} would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent test of the base {\$}\backslashLambda CDM{\$} model.},

abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 is a nearby ultra-cool dwarf that is host to a remarkable planetary system consisting of seven transiting planets. The orbital properties and radii of the planets have been well-constrained, and recently the masses of the inner six planets have been measured with additional ground and space-based photometric observations. Large uncertainties in these mass measurements have prevented a robust analysis of the planetary compositions. Here we perform many thousands of N-body dynamical simulations with planet properties perturbed from the observed values and identify those that are stable for millions of years. This allows us to identify self-consistent orbital solutions that can be used in future studies. From our range of dynamical masses, we find that most of the planets are consistent with an Earth-like composition, where TRAPPIST-1f is likely to have a volatile-rich envelope.},

abstract = {We investigate the chemical stability of CO2-dominated atmospheres of M dwarf terrestrial exoplanets using a 1-dimensional photochemical model. On planets orbiting Sun-like stars, the photolysis of CO2 by Far-UV (FUV) radiation is balanced by the reaction between CO and OH, the rate of which depends on H2O abundance. By comparison, planets orbiting M dwarf stars experience higher FUV radiation compared to planets orbiting Sun-like stars, and they are also likely to have low H2O abundance due to M dwarfs having a prolonged, high-luminosity pre-main sequence (Luger {\&} Barnes 2015). We show that, for H2O-depleted planets around M dwarfs, a CO2-dominated atmosphere is stable to conversion to CO and O2 by relying on a catalytic cycle involving H2O2 photolysis. However, this cycle breaks down for planets with atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratios below {\~{}}1 ppm, resulting in {\~{}}40{\%} of the atmospheric CO2 being converted to CO and O2 on a time scale of 1 Myr. The increased abundance of O2 also results in high O3 concentrations, which reacts with HO2 to generate OH, forming another catalytic cycle capable of stabilizing CO2. For atmospheres with {\textless}0.1 ppm hydrogen, excess O atoms resulting from O3 photolysis react with CO and a third body to directly produce CO2. This series of catalytic cycles places an upper limit of {\~{}}50{\%} on the amount of CO2 that can be destroyed via photolysis in such a dry atmosphere, which is enough to generate abundances of abiotic O2 and O3 rivaling that of modern Earth. Discrimination between O2 and O3 produced biologically and those produced abiotically through photolysis can perhaps be accomplished by noting the lack of water features in the spectra of these H2O-depleted planets, which necessitates observations in the infrared.},

abstract = {One of the primary open questions of astrobiology is whether there is extant or extinct life elsewhere the Solar System. Implicit in much of this work is that we are looking for microbial or, at best, unintelligent life, even though technological artifacts might be much easier to find. SETI work on searches for alien artifacts in the Solar System typically presumes that such artifacts would be of extrasolar origin, even though life is known to have existed in the Solar System, on Earth, for eons. But if a prior technological, perhaps spacefaring, species ever arose in the Solar System, it might have produced artifacts or other technosignatures that have survived to present day, meaning Solar System artifact SETI provides a potential path to resolving astrobiology's question. Here, I discuss the origins and possible locations for technosignatures of such a {\$}prior{\$} {\$}indigenous{\$} {\$}technological{\$} {\$}species{\$}, which might have arisen on ancient Earth or another body, such as a pre-greenhouse Venus or a wet Mars. In the case of Venus, the arrival of its global greenhouse and potential resurfacing might have erased all evidence of its existence on the Venusian surface. In the case of Earth, erosion and, ultimately, plate tectonics may have erased most such evidence if the species lived Gyr ago. Remaining indigenous technosignatures might be expected to be extremely old, limiting the places they might still be found to beneath the surfaces of Mars and the Moon, or in the outer Solar System.},

The timing of the C17 data release, shortly before science operations begin with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), also lets us exercise some of the tools and methods developed for identification and dissemination of planet candidates from TESS. We find excellent agreement between these results and those identified using only K2-based tools. Among our planet candidates are several planet candidates with sizes {\textless} 4 R{\_}E and orbiting stars with KepMag {\textless} 10 (indicating good RV targets of the sort TESS hopes to find) and a Jupiter-sized single-transit event around a star already hosting a 6 d planet candidate.},

abstract = {Gravity darkening induced by rapid stellar rotation provides us with a unique opportunity to char-acterize the spin-orbit misalignment of a planetary system through analysis of its photometric transit. We use the gravity-darkened transit modeling code simuTrans to reproduce the transit light curve of Kepler -13Ab by separately analyzing phase-folded transits for 12 short-cadence Kepler quarters. We verify the temporal change in impact parameter indicative of spin-orbit precession identified by Szab{\'{o}} et al. (2012) and Masuda (2015), reporting a rate of change db/dt = (−4.1 ± 0.2) × 10 −5 day −1 . We further investigate the effect of light dilution on the fitted impact parameter and find that less than 1{\%} of additional light is sufficient to explain the seasonal variation seen in the Kepler quarter data. We then extend our precession analysis to the phase curve data from which we report a rate of change db/dt = (−3.2 ± 1.3) × 10 −5 day −1 . This value is consistent with that of the transit data at a lower significance and provides the first evidence of spin-orbit precession based solely on the temporal variation of the secondary eclipse.},

abstract = {The alignment of Saturn's magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period. The period was previously determined from radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft to be 10h 39m 22.4s. When the Cassini spacecraft measured a period of 10h 47m 6s, which was additionally found to change between sequential measurements, it became clear that the radio period could not be used to determine the bulk planetary rotation period. Estimates based upon Saturn's measured wind fields have increased the uncertainty even more, giving numbers smaller than the Voyager rotation period, and at present Saturn's rotation period is thought to be between 10h 32m and 10h 47m, which is unsatisfactory for such a fundamental property. Here we report a period of 10h 32m 45s +- 46s, based upon an optimization approach using Saturn's measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. Moreover, even when solely using the constraints from its gravitational field, the rotation period can be inferred with a precision of several minutes. To validate our method, we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.},

EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation (PLD) to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft's pointing error and a Gaussian process (GP) to capture astrophysical variability. We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than {\$}K{\_}p \backslashapprox 13{\$}, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets.

abstract = {Our present-day atmosphere is often used as an analog for potentially habitable exoplanets, but Earth's atmosphere has changed dramatically throughout its 4.5 billion year history. For example, molecular oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere today but was absent on the early Earth. Meanwhile, the physical and chemical evolution of Earth's atmosphere has also resulted in major swings in surface temperature, at times resulting in extreme glaciation or warm greenhouse climates. Despite this dynamic and occasionally dramatic history, the Earth has been persistently habitable--and, in fact, inhabited--for roughly 4 billion years. Understanding Earth's momentous changes and its enduring habitability is essential as a guide to the diversity of habitable planetary environments that may exist beyond our solar system and for ultimately recognizing spectroscopic fingerprints of life elsewhere in the Universe. Here, we review long-term trends in the composition of Earth's atmosphere as it relates to both planetary habitability and inhabitation. We focus on gases that may serve as habitability markers (CO2, N2) or biosignatures (CH4, O2), especially as related to the redox evolution of the atmosphere and the coupled evolution of Earth's climate system. We emphasize that in the search for Earth-like planets we must be mindful that the example provided by the modern atmosphere merely represents a single snapshot of Earth's long-term evolution. In exploring the many former states of our own planet, we emphasize Earth's atmospheric evolution during the Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic eons, but we conclude with a brief discussion of potential atmospheric trajectories into the distant future, many millions to billions of years from now. All of these 'Alternative Earth' scenarios provide insight to the potential diversity of Earth-like, habitable, and inhabited worlds.},

abstract = {A variety of observations provide evidence for vigorous motion in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets. Motivated by these observations, we examine the dynamical regime of the circulation in the atmospheres and interiors of these objects. Brown dwarfs rotate rapidly, and for plausible wind speeds, the flow at large scales will be rotationally dominated. We present 3D, global, numerical simulations of convection in the interior, which demonstrate that, at large scales, the convection aligns in the direction parallel to the rotation axis. Convection occurs more efficiently at high latitudes than low latitudes, leading to systematic equator-to-pole temperature differences that may reach {\~{}}1 K near the top of the convection zone. The interaction of convection with the overlying, stably stratified atmosphere will generate a wealth of atmospheric waves, and we argue that, as in the stratospheres of planets in the solar system, the interaction of these waves with the mean flow will cause a significant atmospheric circulation at regional to global scales. At large scales, this should consist of stratified turbulence (possibly organizing into coherent structures such as vortices and jets) and an accompanying overturning circulation. We present an approximate analytic theory of this circulation, which predicts characteristic horizontal temperature variations of several to {\~{}}50 K, horizontal wind speeds of {\~{}}10-300 m/sec, and vertical velocities that advect air over a scale height in {\~{}}10{\^{}}5-10{\^{}}6 sec. This vertical mixing may help to explain the chemical disequilibrium observed on some brown dwarfs. Moreover, the implied large-scale organization of temperature perturbations and vertical velocities suggests that, near the L/T transition, patchy clouds can form near the photosphere, helping to explain recent observations of brown-dwarf variability in the near-IR.},

abstract = {The Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP) provides a large sample of protoplanetary disks having substructures which could be induced by young forming planets. To explore the properties of planets that may be responsible for these substructures, we systematically carry out a grid of 2-D hydrodynamical simulations including both gas and dust components. We present the resulting gas structures, including the relationship between the planet mass and 1) the gaseous gap depth/width, and 2) the sub/super-Keplerian motion across the gap. We then compute dust continuum intensity maps at the frequency of the DSHARP observations. We provide the relationship between the planet mass and 1) the depth/width of the gaps at millimeter intensity maps, 2) the gap edge ellipticity and asymmetry, and 3) the position of secondary gaps induced by the planet. With these relationships, we lay out the procedure to constrain the planet mass using gap properties, and study the potential planets in the DSHARP disks. We highlight the excellent agreement between observations and simulations for AS 209 and the detectability of the young Solar System analog. Finally , under the assumption that the detected gaps are induced by young planets, we characterize the young planet population in the planet mass-semimajor axis diagram. We find that the occurrence rate for {\textgreater} 5 M J planets beyond 5-10 au is consistent with direct imaging constraints. Disk substructures allow us probe a wide-orbit planet population (Neptune to Jupiter mass planets beyond 10 au) that is not accessible to other planet searching techniques.

These are the first published WFC3 observations of a transiting exoplanet atmosphere. After correcting for a ramp-like instrumental systematic, we achieve nearly photon-limited precision in these observations, finding the transmission spectrum of GJ1214b to be flat between 1.1 and 1.7 $\mu$m. Inconsistent with a cloud-free solar composition atmosphere at 8.2$\sigma$, the measured achromatic transit depth most likely implies a large mean molecular weight for GJ1214b's outer envelope. A dense atmosphere rules out bulk compositions for GJ1214b that explain its large radius by the presence of a very low density gas layer surrounding the planet. High-altitude clouds can alternatively explain the flat transmission spectrum, but they would need to be optically thick up to 10 mbar or consist of particles with a range of sizes approaching 1 $\mu$m in diameter.},

We find that when the {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} value near the mesopause/homopause level exceeds a critical value of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2.5, there exists a steady hydrodynamic solution with a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic flow. For a fixed XUV flux, the escape rate of the upper atmosphere is an increasing function of the temperature at the lower boundary. Our model results indicate a crucial enhancement of the atmospheric escape rate, when the Jeans escape parameter {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} decreases to this critical value. When {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} becomes {\$}\backslashleq{\$}2.5, there is no stationary hydrodynamic transition from subsonic to supersonic flow.

abstract = {The recovery of an exoplanet's atmospheric parameters from its spectrum requires accurate knowledge of the spectral errors and covariances. Unfortunately, the complex image processing used in high-contrast integral-field spectrograph (IFS) observations generally produces spectral covariances that are poorly understood and often ignored. In this work, we show how to measure the spectral errors and covariances and include them self-consistently in parameter retrievals. By combining model exoplanet spectra with a realistic noise model generated from GPI early science data, we show that ignoring spectral covariance in high-contrast IFS data can both bias inferred parameters and lead to unreliable confidence regions on those parameters. This problem is made worse by the common practice of scaling the {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} per degree of freedom to unity; the input parameters then fall outside the {\$}95\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence regions in as many as {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}80\backslash{\%}{\$} of noise realizations. Accounting for realistic priors in fully Bayesian parameter retrievals can also have a significant impact on the inferred parameters. As an example, we show that plausible priors on effective temperature and surface gravity can vary by as much as an order of magnitude across the {\$}95\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence regions appropriate for objects with weak age constraints like GJ 504b and {\$}\backslashkappa{\$} And b.

abstract = {Surveys have revealed many multi-planet systems containing super-Earths and Neptunes in orbits of a few days to a few months. There is debate whether in situ assembly or inward migration is the dominant mechanism of the formation of such planetary systems. Simulations suggest that migration creates tightly packed systems with planets whose orbital periods may be expressed as ratios of small integers (resonances), often in a many-planet series (chain). In the hundreds of multi-planet systems of sub-Neptunes, more planet pairs are observed near resonances than would generally be expected, but no individual system has hitherto been identified that must have been formed by migration. Proximity to resonance enables the detection of planets perturbing each other. Here we report transit timing variations of the four planets in the Kepler-223 system, model these variations as resonant-angle librations, and compute the long-term stability of the resonant chain. The architecture of Kepler-223 is too finely tuned to have been formed by scattering, and our numerical simulations demonstrate that its properties are natural outcomes of the migration hypothesis. Similar systems could be destabilized by any of several mechanisms, contributing to the observed orbital-period distribution, where many planets are not in resonances. Planetesimal interactions in particular are thought to be responsible for establishing the current orbits of the four giant planets in the Solar System by disrupting a theoretical initial resonant chain similar to that observed in Kepler-223.},

By contrast, short-period exoplanets have such high temperatures that their atmospheres have water in the gas phase, making it possible to measure the water abundance for these objects. We present a precise determination of the water abundance in the atmosphere of the 2 M Jup short-period exoplanet WASP-43b based on thermal emission and transmission spectroscopy measurements obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find the water content is consistent with the value expected in a solar composition gas at planetary temperatures (0.4-3.5× solar at 1$\sigma$ confidence).

abstract = {Context. We have already imaged a co-moving companion at a projected separation of ∼260 AU from the young star AB Pic A. Evolutionary model predictions based on JHK photometry of AB Pic b suggest a mass of ∼13−14 M Jup , placing the object at the deuterium-burning boundary. Aims. We aim to determine the spectral type, the surface gravity, and the effective temperature of AB Pic b. From the comparison of our absolute photometry to surface fluxes generated by atmospheric models, we also aim at deriving mass and radius estimates that are independent of evolutionary model predictions to test and refine them. Methods. We used the adaptive-optics-fed integral field spectrograph SINFONI to obtain high-quality, medium-resolution spectra of AB Pic b (R $\lambda$ = 1500−2000) over the 1.1−2.5 $\mu$m range. Our analysis relie on comparing our spectra to young standard templates and to the latest libraries of synthetic spectra developed by the Lyon group. Results. AB Pic b is confirmed as a young early-L dwarf companion. We derive a spectral type L0–L1 and find several features indicative of an intermediate gravity atmosphere. A comparison to synthetic spectra yields T eff = 2000 +100 −300 K and log(g) = 4 ± 0.5 dex. Determination of the derived atmospheric parameters of AB Pic b is limited by an imperfect match of current atmosphere spectra with our near-infrared observations of AB Pic b. The current treatment of dust settling and the missing molecular opacity lines in the atmosphere models could be responsible. By combining the observed photometry, the surface fluxes from atmosphere models and the known distance of the system, we derive new mass, luminosity, and radius estimates of AB Pic b. They independently confirm the evolutionary model predictions. We finally review the current methods used for characterizing planetary mass companions and discuss them in the perspective of future planet deep-imaging surveys that will be faced with the same limitations.},

abstract = {We present here our observations and analysis of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-103b. We observed WASP-103b during secondary eclipse using two visits of the Hubble Space Telescope with the G141 grism on Wide Field Camera 3 in spatial scan mode. We generated secondary eclipse light curves of the planet in both blended white-light and spectrally binned wavechannels from 1.1-1.7 micron and corrected the light curves for flux contamination from a nearby companion star. We modeled the detector systematics and secondary eclipse spectrum using Gaussian process regression and found that the near-IR emission spectrum of WASP-103b is featureless across the observed near-IR region to down to a sensitivity of 175 ppm, and shows a shallow slope towards the red. The atmosphere has a single brightness temperature of T{\_}B = 2890 K across this wavelength range. This region of the spectrum is indistinguishable from isothermal, but may not manifest from a physically isothermal system, i.e. pseudo-isothermal. A Solar-metallicity profile with a thermal inversion layer at 10{\^{}}-2 bar fits WASP-103b's spectrum with high confidence, as do an isothermal profile with Solar metallicity and a monotonically decreasing atmosphere with C/O{\textgreater}1. The data rule out a monotonically decreasing atmospheric profile with Solar composition, and we rule out a low-metallicity decreasing profile as non-physical for this system. The pseudo-isothermal profile could be explained by a thermal inversion layer just above the layer probed by our observations, or by clouds or haze in the upper atmosphere. Transmission spectra at optical wavelengths would allow us to better differentiate between potential atmospheric models.},

The likely rotational modulation period is 4.78{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.95 h, although the rotational phase is not well sampled. The minimum relative amplitude in the white light curve measured over the whole wavelength range is 2.41{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.14$\backslash${\%}. We report an unusual light curve with seemingly three peaks approximately evenly distributed in rotational phase. The spectral modulations suggests that the upper atmosphere cloud properties in {\{}LP261-75B{\}} are similar to two other mid-L dwarfs of typical infrared colors, but differ from that of the extremely red L-dwarf WISE0047.},

abstract = {The cool white dwarf SDSS J124231.07+522626.6 exhibits photospheric absorption lines of 8 distinct heavy elements in medium resolution optical spectra, notably including oxygen. The Teff = 13000 K atmosphere is helium-dominated, but the convection zone contains significant amounts of hydrogen and oxygen. The four most common rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, and Fe) account for almost all the accreted mass, totalling at least 1.2e+24 g, similar to the mass of Ceres. The time-averaged accretion rate is 2e+10 g/s, one of the highest rates inferred among all known metal-polluted white dwarfs. We note a large oxygen excess, with respect to the most common metal oxides, suggesting that the white dwarf accreted planetary debris with a water content of {\~{}}38 per cent by mass. This star, together with GD 61, GD 16, and GD 362, form a small group of outliers from the known population of evolved planetary systems accreting predominantly dry, rocky debris. This result strengthens the hypothesis that, integrated over the cooling ages of white dwarfs, accretion of water-rich debris from disrupted planetesimals may significantly contribute to the build-up of trace hydrogen observed in a large fraction of helium-dominated white dwarf atmospheres.},

This dust haze would exist in conjunction with the clouds found in dwarfs with more typical colors. We developed a model which uses Mie theory and the Hansen particle size distributions to reproduce the extinction due to the proposed dust haze. We apply our method to 23 young L dwarfs and 23 red field L dwarfs. We constrain the properties of the dust haze including particle size distribution and column density using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. We find that sub-micron range silicate grains reproduce the observed reddening.

abstract = {Context. We previously reported the direct detection of a low-mass companion at a projected separation of 55 ± 2 AU around the B9-type star $\kappa$ Andromedae. The properties of the system (mass ratio, separation) make it a benchmark for understanding the formation and evolution of gas giant planets and brown dwarfs on wide orbits. Aims. We present new angular differential imaging (ADI) images of the system at 2.146 (K s), 3.776 (L), 4.052 (NB{\_}4.05), and 4.78 µm (M) obtained with Keck/NIRC2 and LBTI/LMIRCam, as well as more accurate near-infrared photometry of the star with the MIMIR instrument. We aim to determine the near-infrared spectral energy distribution of the companion and use it to characterize the object. Methods. We used analysis methods adapted to ADI to extract the companion flux. We compared the photometry of the object to reference young, and old objects and to a set of seven PHOENIX-based atmospheric models of cool objects accounting for the formation of dust. We used evolutionary models to derive mass estimates considering a wide range of plausible initial conditions. Finally, we used dedicated formation models to discuss the possible origin of the companion. Results. We derive a more accurate J = 15.86 ± 0.21, H = 14.95 ± 0.13, K s = 14.32 ± 0.09 mag for $\kappa$ And b. We detect the companion in all our high-contrast observations. We confirm previous contrasts obtained at K s and L band. We derive NB{\_}4.05 = 13.0 ± 0.2, and M = 13.3 ± 0.3 mag and estimate log 10 (L/L) = −3.76 ± 0.06. Atmospheric models yield T eff = 1900 +100 −200 K. They do not set any constraint on the surface gravity. "Hot-start" evolutionary models predict masses of 14 +25 −2 M Jup based on the luminosity and temperature estimates, and when considering a conservative age range for the system (30 +120 −10 Myr), "warm-start" evolutionary tracks constrain the mass to M ≥ 10 M Jup. Conclusions. The mass of $\kappa$ Andromedae b mostly falls in the brown-dwarf regime, owing to remaining uncertainties in age and in mass-luminosity models. According to the formation models, disk instability in a primordial disk may account for the position and a wide range of plausible masses of $\kappa$ And b.},

abstract = {We report on 176 close ({\textless} 2 ") stellar companions detected with high-resolution imaging near 170 hosts of Kepler Objects of Interest. These Kepler targets were prioritized for imaging follow-up based on the presence of small planets, so most of the KOIs in these systems (176 out of 204) have nominal radii {\textless} 6 R⊕. Each KOI in our sample was observed in at least 2 filters with adaptive optics, speckle imaging, lucky imaging, or HST. Multi-filter photometry provides color information on the companions, allowing us to constrain their stellar properties and assess the probability that the companions are physically bound. We find that 60 – 80{\%} of companions within 1 " are bound, and the bound fraction is {\textgreater} 90{\%} for companions within 0.5 " ; the bound fraction decreases with increasing angular separation. This picture is consistent with simulations of the binary and background stellar populations in the Kepler field. We also reassess the planet radii in these systems, converting the observed differential magnitudes to a contamination in the Kepler bandpass and calculating the planet radius correction factor, XR = Rp(true)/Rp(single). Under the assumption that planets in bound binaries are equally likely to orbit the primary or secondary, we find a mean radius correction factor for planets in stellar multiples of XR = 1.65. If stellar multiplicity in the Kepler field is similar to the solar neighborhood, then nearly half of all Kepler planets may have radii underestimated by an average of 65{\%}, unless vetted using high resolution imaging or spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Terrestrial planets formed within gaseous protoplanetary disks can accumulate significant hydrogen envelopes. The evolution of such an atmosphere due to XUV driven evaporation depends on the activity evolution of the host star, which itself depends sensitively on its rotational evolution, and therefore on its initial rotation rate. In this letter, we derive an easily applicable method for calculating planetary atmosphere evaporation that combines models for a hydrostatic lower atmosphere and a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere. We show that the initial rotation rate of the central star is of critical importance for the evolution of planetary atmospheres and can determine if a planet keeps or loses its primordial hydrogen envelope. Our results highlight the need for a detailed treatment of stellar activity evolution when studying the evolution of planetary atmospheres.},

abstract = {A new piece of evidence supporting the photoevaporation-driven evolution model for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the California-Kepler Survey. The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is shown to be bimodal, with a "valley" separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6 R ⊕. Such an "evaporation valley" had been predicted by numerical models previously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley results from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the longest for those planets with hydrogen/ helium-rich envelopes that, while only a few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes lighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for tenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation therefore herds planets into either bare cores (∼1.3 R ⊕), or those with double the core's radius (∼2.6 R ⊕). This process mostly occurs during the first 100 Myr when the stars' high-energy fluxes are high and nearly constant. The observed radius distribution further requires the Kepler planets to be clustered around 3 M ⊕ in mass, born with H/He envelopes more than a few percent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition. Such envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks, while the core composition indicates formation inside the ice line. Lastly, the photoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ∼30-60 days; if these planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for planet formation, resembling the solar system terrestrial planets.},

This manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of different methods for error estimation that are applicable to both model-based and model-independent parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the methods for error estimation discussed are grid search, varying {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$}, the Fisher matrix, Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data resampling, and bootstrapping.

The intended focus was to be carbon, but sulfur photochemistry turns out to be important. The case for organic photochemical hazes is intriguing but falls short of being compelling. If organic hazes form, they are likeliest to do so if vertical mixing in 51 Eri b is weaker than in Jupiter, and they would be found below the altitudes where methane and water are photolyzed. The more novel result is that photochemistry turns H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S into elemental sulfur, here treated as S{\$}{\_}8{\$}. In the cooler models, S{\$}{\_}8{\$} is predicted to condense in optically thick clouds of solid sulfur particles, whilst in the warmer models S{\$}{\_}8{\$} remains a vapor along with several other sulfur allotropes that are both visually striking and potentially observable. For 51 Eri b, the division between models with and without condensed sulfur is at an effective temperature of 700 K, which is within error its actual effective temperature; the local temperature where sulfur condenses is between 280 and 320 K. The sulfur photochemistry we have discussed is quite general and ought to be found in a wide variety of worlds over a broad temperature range, both colder and hotter than the 650-750 K range studied here, and we show that products of sulfur photochemistry will be nearly as abundant on planets where the UV irradiation is orders of magnitude weaker than it is on 51 Eri b.},

To detect and characterize inhomogeneities in its atmosphere (e.g., patchy clouds, hot spots), we have performed time-series photometric monitoring of WISE 0855-0714 at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the Spitzer Space Telescope during two 23{\~{}}hr periods that were separated by several months. For both bands, we have detected variability with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 4-5{\%} and 3-4{\%} in the first and second epochs, respectively. The light curves are semi-periodic in the first epoch for both bands, but are more irregular in the second epoch. Models of patchy clouds have predicted a large increase in mid-IR variability amplitudes (for a given cloud covering fraction) with the appearance of water ice clouds at {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\textless}{\$}375 K, so if such clouds are responsible for the variability of WISE 0855-0714, then its small amplitudes of variability indicate a very small deviation in cloud coverage between hemispheres. Alternatively, the similarity in mid-IR variability amplitudes between WISE 0855-0714 and somewhat warmer T and Y dwarfs may suggest that they share a common origin for their variability (i.e., not water clouds). In addition to our variability data, we have examined other constraints on the presence of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of WISE 0855-0714, including the recent mid-IR spectrum from $\backslash$citet{\{}ske16{\}}. We find that robust evidence of such clouds is not yet available.},

Given its importance for testing planet formation and evolution theories, and for assessing the prospects for habitability among Earth-size exoplanets orbiting the most common type of star in the Galaxy, we present a comprehensive assessment of the age of this system. We collate empirical age constraints based on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, average density, lithium absorption, surface gravity features, metallicity, kinematics, rotation, and magnetic activity; and conclude that TRAPPIST-1 is a transitional thin/thick disk star with an age of 7.6{\$}\backslashpm{\$}2.2 Gyr. The star's color-magnitude position is consistent with it being slightly metal-rich ([Fe/H] {\$}\backslashsimeq{\$} +0.06), in line with its previously reported near-infrared spectroscopic metallicity; and it has a radius (R = 0.121{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.003 R{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) that is larger by 8-14{\%} compared to solar-metallicity evolutionary models.

The HPF will cover the NIR Y {\&} J bands to enable precise radial velocities to be obtained on mid M dwarfs, and enable the detection of low mass planets around these stars. The conceptual design is comprised of a cryostat cooled to 200K, a dual fiber-feed with a science and calibration fiber, a gold coated mosaic echelle grating, and a Teledyne Hawaii-2RG (H2RG) NIR detector with a 1.7{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m cutoff. A uranium-neon hollow-cathode lamp is the baseline wavelength calibration source, and we are actively testing laser frequency combs to enable even higher radial velocity precision.

abstract = {We describe how to generate a longitudinal brightness map for a tidally locked exoplanet from its phase function light curve. We operate under a number of simplifying assumptions, neglecting limb darkening/brightening, star spots, detector ramps, as well as time variability over a single planetary rotation. We develop the transformation from a planetary brightness map to a phase function light curve and simplify the expression for the case of an edge-on system. We introduce two models-composed of longitudinal slices of uniform brightness, and sinu-soidally varying maps-which greatly simplify the transformation from map to light curve. We discuss numerical approaches to extracting a longitudinal map from a phase function light curve, explaining how to estimate the uncertainty in a computed map and how to choose an appropriate number of fit parameters. We demonstrate these techniques on a simulated map and discuss the uses and limitations of longitudinal maps. The sinusoidal model provides a better fit to the planet's underlying brightness map, although the slice model is more appropriate for light curves which only span a fraction of the planet's orbit. Regardless of which model is used, we find that there is a maximum of ∼5 free parameters which can be meaningfully fit based on a full phase function light curve, due to the insensitivity of the latter to certain modes of the map. This is sufficient to determine the longitudes of primary equatorial hot spots and cold spots, as well as the presence of secondary maxima/minima.},

By using the nearby binary stars Kepler-13BC as a reference, we were able to create a differential light curve for Kepler-13A that had little of the systematics typically present in HST/WFC3 spectrophotometry. We measure a broadband (1.1{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m to 1.65{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m) eclipse depth of {\$}734\backslashpm28{\$} ppm, and are able to measure the emission spectrum of the planet at {\$}R\backslashapprox50{\$} with an average precision of 70 ppm. Our observations do not well sample either the eclipse ingress or egress, and so we are not able to provide meaningful constraints on the eclipse timing offset observed by Shporer et al. (2014). We do find that our observations, combined with those of Shporer et al. (2014) give an average dayside brightness temperature of 3000 K, and are consistent with a non-inverted, monotonically decreasing vertical temperature profile at 2.4{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}. We exclude an isothermal profile and an inverted profile. We also find that the dayside emission of Kepler-13Ab appears generally similar to an isolated M7 brown dwarf at a similar effective temperature. Due to the relatively high mass and surface gravity of Kepler-13Ab, we suggest that the apparent lack of an inversion is due to cold-trap processes in the planet's atmosphere. Using a toy-model for where cold-traps should inhibit inversions, and observations of other planets in this temperature range with measured emission spectra, we argue that with more detailed modeling and more observations we may be able to place useful constraints on the size of condensates on the daysides of hot Jupiters.},

abstract = {GJ 758 B is a brown dwarf companion to a nearby (15.76{\%}) solar-type, metal-rich (M/H = +0.2 dex) main-sequence star (G9V) that was discovered with Subaru/HiCIAO in 2009. From previous studies, it has drawn attention as being the coldest (∼600 K) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star. We present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of the SPHERE instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The data was obtained in Y-, J-, Hand nd K s-bands with the dual-band imaging (DBI) mode of IRDIS, thus providing a broad coverage of the full near-infrared (near-IR) range at higher contrast and better spectral sampling than previously reported. In this new set of high-quality data, we report the re-detection of the companion, as well as the first detection of a new candidate closer-in to the star. We use the new eight photometric points for an extended comparison of GJ 758 B with empirical objects and four families of atmospheric models. From comparison to empirical object, we estimate a T8 spectral type, but none of the comparison objects can accurately represent the observed near-IR fluxes of GJ 758 B. From comparison to atmospheric models, we attribute a T eff = 600 ± 100 K, but we find that no atmospheric model can adequately fit all the fluxes of GJ 758 B. The lack of exploration of metal enrichment in model grids appears as a major limitation that prevents an accurate estimation of the companion physical parameters. The photometry of the new candidate companion is broadly consistent with L-type objects, but a second epoch with improved photometry is necessary to clarify its status. The new astrometry of GJ 758 B shows a significant proper motion since the last epoch. We use this result to improve the determination of the orbital characteristics using two fitting approaches: Least-Squares Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo. We confirm the high-eccentricity of the orbit (peak at 0.5), and find a most likely semi-major axis of 46.05 AU. We also use our imaging data, as well as archival radial velocity data, to reject the possibility that this is a false positive effect created by an unseen, closer-in, companion. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of our data to additional closer-in companions and reject the possibility of other massive brown dwarf companions down to 4-5 AU.},

It remains unclear if the aerosols muting the spectroscopic features of exoplanet atmospheres are condensate clouds or photochemical hazes, which is difficult to predict from theory alone. We present here the first laboratory haze simulation experiments for atmospheric compositions expected for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. We explored temperatures from 300 to 600 K and a range of atmospheric metallicities (100x, 1000x, 10000x solar); all simulated atmospheres produced particles, and the cooler (300 and 400 K) 1000x solar metallicity ("H2O-dominated", CH4-rich) experiments exhibited haze production rates higher than our standard Titan simulation ({\~{}}10 mg/hr versus 7.4 mg/hr for Titan). However the particle production rates varied greatly, with measured rates as low as 0.04 mg/hr (100x solar metallicity, 600 K).

abstract = {The cosmic optical background is an important observable that constrains energy production in stars and more exotic physical processes in the universe, and provides a crucial cosmological benchmark against which to judge theories of structure formation. Measurement of the absolute brightness of this background is complicated by local foregrounds like the Earth's atmosphere and sunlight reflected from local interplanetary dust, and large discrepancies in the inferred brightness of the optical background have resulted. Observations from probes far from the Earth are not affected by these bright foregrounds. Here we analyze data from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) instrument on NASA's New Horizons mission acquired during cruise phase outside the orbit of Jupiter, and find a statistical upper limit on the optical background's brightness similar to the integrated light from galaxies. We conclude that a carefully performed survey with LORRI could yield uncertainties comparable to those from galaxy counting measurements.},

abstract = {Kepler has detected numerous exoplanet transits by precise measurements of stellar light in a single visible-wavelength band. In addition to detection, the precise photometry provides phase curves of exoplanets, which can be used to study the dynamic processes on these planets. However, the interpretation of these observations can be complicated by the fact that visible-wavelength phase curves can represent both thermal emission and scattering from the planets. Here we present a semi-analytical model framework that can be applied to study Kepler and future visible-wavelength phase curve observations of exoplanets. The model efficiently computes reflection and thermal emission components for both rocky and gaseous planets, considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous surfaces or atmospheres. We analyze the phase curves of the gaseous planet Kepler-7 b and the rocky planet Kepler-10 b using the model. In general, we find that a hot exoplanet's visible-wavelength phase curve having a significant phase offset can usually be explained by two classes of solutions: one class requires a thermal hot spot shifted to one side of the substellar point, and the other class requires reflective clouds concentrated on the same side of the substellar point. The two solutions would require very different Bond albedos to fit the same phase curve; atmospheric circulation models or eclipse observations at longer wavelengths can effectively rule out one class of solutions, and thus pinpoint the albedo of the planet, allowing decomposition of the reflection and the thermal emission components in the phase curve. Particularly for Kepler-7 b, reflective clouds located on the west side of the substellar point can best explain its phase curve. We further derive that the reflectivity of the clear part of the atmosphere should be less than 7{\%} and that of the cloudy part should be greater than 80{\%} (abridged)},

Combining our results with those for 86 other L and T dwarfs from the literature show that the detection rate of H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission is very high (94{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) for spectral types between L0 and L3.5 and much smaller (20{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) for spectral types {\$}\backslashge{\$}L4, while the detection rate of photometric variability is approximately constant (30{\$}\backslash{\%}-{\$}55{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) from L0 to T8 dwarfs. We conclude that chromospheric activity, as evidenced by H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission, and large-amplitude photometric variability are not correlated. Consequently, dust clouds are the dominant driver of the observed variability of ultra-cool dwarfs at spectral types at least as early as L0.},

The transit-time variations depend on the mass of the additional planet, and in some cases terrestrial-mass planets will produce a measurable effect. In systems where two planets are seen to transit, the density of both planets can be determined without radial-velocity observations.},

We study the wavelength dependence of rotation-modulated flux variations between 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.7 $\mu$m. We find that the water absorption bands of the two L5 dwarfs at 1.15 $\mu$m and 1.4 $\mu$m vary at similar amplitudes as the adjacent continuum. This differs from the results of previous HST observations of L/T transition dwarfs, in which the water absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m displays variations of about half of the amplitude at other wavelengths. We find that the relative amplitude of flux variability out of the water band with respect to that in the water band shows a increasing trend from the L5 dwarfs toward the early T dwarfs. We utilize the models of Saumon {\&} Marley and find that the observed variability of the L5 dwarfs can be explained by the presence of spatially varying high-altitude haze layers above the condensate clouds. Therefore, our observations show that the heterogeneity of haze layers—the driver of the variability—must be located at very low pressures, where even the water opacity is negligible. In the near future, the rotational spectral mapping technique could be utilized for other atomic and molecular species to probe different pressure levels in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets and uncover both horizontal and vertical cloud structures.},

To refine the target catalogue for the forthcoming Taipan Galaxy Survey, the images of a large number of sources are being visually inspected in order to identify objects that are confused by a foreground star or galaxies that have a distinct multi-component structure. An unexpected by-product of this work has been the serendipitous discovery of about a dozen galaxies that appear to be lensing quasars, i.e. pairs or quartets of foreground stellar objects in close proximity to the target source. Here we report two diamond-shaped systems. Follow-up spectroscopy with the IMACS instrument on the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope confirms one of these as a z = 1.975 quasar quadruply lensed by a double galaxy at z = 0.293. Photometry from publicly available survey images supports the conclusion that the other system is a highly sheared quadruply-imaged quasar. In starting with objects thought to be galaxies, our lens finding technique complements the conventional approach of first identifying sources with quasar-like colours and subsequently finding evidence of lensing.},

abstract = {Condensate clouds strongly impact the spectra of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Recent discoveries of variable L/T transition dwarfs argued for patchy clouds in at least some ultracool atmospheres. This study aims to measure the frequency and level of spectral variability in brown dwarfs and to search for correlations with spectral type.We used Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 to obtain spectroscopic time series for 22 brown dwarfs of spectral types ranging from L5 to T6 at 1.1–1.7µmfor≈40 minutes per object. Using Bayesian analysis, we find six brown dwarfs with confident (p{\textgreater} 95{\%}) variability in the relative flux in at least one wavelength region at sub-percent precision, and five brown dwarfs with tentative (p{\textgreater} 68{\%}) variability. We derive a minimum variability fraction mid-T −7{\%}over all covered spectral types. The fraction of variables is equal within errors formid-L, late-L, and fmin = 27+11 spectral types; for early-T dwarfs we do not find any confident variable but the sample is too small to derive meaningful limits. For some objects, the variability occurs primarily in the flux peak in the J or H band, others are variable throughout the spectrum or only in specific absorption regions. Four sources may have broadband peak-to-peak amplitudes exceeding 1{\%}. Our measurements are not sensitive to very long periods, inclinations near pole-on and rotationally symmetric heterogeneity. The detection statistics are consistent with most brown dwarf photospheres being patchy. While multiple-percent near-infrared variability may be rare and confined to the L/T transition, low-level heterogeneities are a frequent characteristic of brown dwarf atmospheres. Key},

Strong Ly$\alpha$ emission irradiates a warm disk surface within 2 AU of the central star and pumps certain excited levels of H2. We simulate a one-dimensional plane-parallel atmosphere to estimate fluxes for the 140 observed H2 emission lines and to reconstruct the Ly$\alpha$ emission profile incident upon the warm H2. The excitation of H2 can be determined from relative line strengths by measuring self-absorption in lines with low-energy lower levels, or by reconstructing the Ly$\alpha$ profile incident upon the warm H2 using the total flux from a single upper level and the opacity in the pumping transition. Based on those diagnostics, we estimate that the warm disk surface has a column density of logN(H2)=18.5+1.2-0.8, a temperature T=2500+700-500 K, and a filling factor of H2, as seen by the source of Ly$\alpha$ emission, of 0.25+/-0.08 (all 2 $\sigma$ error bars). TW Hya produces approximately 10-3 Lsolar in the FUV, about 85{\%} of which is in the Ly$\alpha$ emission line.

Nevertheless, the D/H ratio of each pure component in this mixture should yield a comprehensible signature of the origin and evolution of water and organic matter in our solar system. We measured hydrogen isotope ratios of organic and hydrous silicates in the matrices of two carbonaceous chondrites (Orgueil CI1 and Renazzo CR2) and one unequilibrated ordinary chondrite (Semarkona, LL3.0). A novel protocol was adopted, involving NanoSIMS imaging of H isotopes of monoatomatic ({\$}H{\^{}}-{\$}) and molecular ({\$}OH{\^{}}-{\$}) secondary ions collected at the same location. This allowed the most enriched component with respect to D to be identified in the mixture. Using this protocol, we found that in carbonaceous chondrites the isotopically homogeneous hydrous silicates are mixed with D-rich organic matter. The opposite was observed in Semarkona. Hydrous silicates in Semarkona display highly heterogeneous D/H ratios, ranging from {\$}150{\$} to {\$}1800{\$} {\$}{\{}\backslashtimes{\}}{\$} {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}{\$} ({\$}{\{}\backslashdelta{\}}D{\_}{\{}SMOW{\}} = -40{\$} to {\$}10,600{\$} permil).

Our study greatly expands the range of water isotopic values measured so far in solar system objects. This D-rich water reservoir was sampled by the LL ordinary chondrite parent body and an estimate (up to 9 {\%}) of its relative contribution to the D/H ratio of water in Oort cloud family comets is proposed.},

However, converting line lists into cross sections via line broadening involves a series of prescriptions for which the uncertainties are not well understood.

abstract = {Most planetary systems are formed within stellar clusters, and these environments can shape their properties. This paper considers scattering encounters between solar systems and passing cluster members, and calculates the corresponding interaction cross sections. The target solar systems are generally assumed to have four giant planets, with a variety of starting states, including circular orbits with the semimajor axes of our planets, a more compact configuration, an ultra-compact state with multiple mean motion resonances, and systems with massive planets. We then consider the effects of varying the cluster velocity dispersion, the relative importance of binaries versus single stars, different stellar host masses, and finite starting eccentricities of the planetary orbits. For each state of the initial system, we perform an ensemble of numerical scattering experiments and determine the cross sections for eccentricity increase, inclination angle increase, planet ejection, and capture. This paper reports results from over 2 million individual scattering simulations. Using supporting analytic considerations, and fitting functions to the numerical results, we find a universal formula that gives the cross sections as a function of stellar host mass, cluster velocity dispersion, starting planetary orbital radius, and final eccentricity. The resulting cross sections can be used in a wide variety of applications. As one example, we revisit constraints on the birth aggregate of our Solar System due to dynamical scattering and find {\$}N{\textless}10{\^{}}4{\$} (consistent with previous estimates).},

abstract = {At the dawn of the first discovery of exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars in the mid-1990s, few believed that observations of exoplanet atmospheres would ever be possible. After the 2002 Hubble Space Telescope detection of a tran-siting exoplanet atmosphere, many skeptics discounted it as a one-object, one-method success. Nevertheless, the field is now firmly established, with over two dozen exoplanet atmospheres observed today. Hot Jupiters are the type of exoplanet currently most amenable to study. Highlights include: de-tection of molecular spectral features, observation of day-night temperature gradients, and constraints on vertical atmospheric structure. Atmospheres of giant planets far from their host stars are also being studied with direct imaging. The ultimate exoplanet goal is to answer the enigmatic and ancient question, " Are we alone? " via detection of atmospheric biosignatures. Two exciting prospects are the immediate focus on transiting super Earths orbit-ing in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs, and ultimately the spaceborne direct imaging of true Earth analogs.},

abstract = {Planets can emit polarized thermal radiation, just like brown dwarfs. We present calculated thermal polarization signals from hot exoplanets, using an advanced radiative transfer code that fully includes all orders of scattering by gaseous molecules and cloud particles. The code spatially resolves the disk of the planet, allowing simulations for horizontally inhomogeneous planets. Our results show that the degree of linear polarization, P, of an exoplanet's thermal radiation is expected to be highest near the planet's limb and that this P depends on the temperature and its gradient, the scattering properties, and the distribution of the cloud particles. Integrated over the disk of a spherically symmetric planet, P of the thermal radiation equals zero. However, for planets that appear spherically asymmetric, e.g., due to flattening, cloud bands or spots in their atmosphere, differences in their day and night sides, and/or obscuring rings, P is often larger than 0.1{\%}, in favorable cases even reaching several percent at near-infrared wavelengths. Detection of thermal polarization signals can give access to planetary parameters that are otherwise hard to obtain: it immediately confirms the presence of clouds, and P can then constrain atmospheric inhomogeneities and the flattening due to the planet's rotation rate. For zonally symmetric planets, the angle of polarization will yield the components of the planet's spin axis normal to the line of sight. Finally, our simulations show that P is generally more sensitive to variability in a cloudy planet's atmosphere than the thermal flux is, and could hence better reveal certain dynamical processes.},

Denoting {\$}n{\_}b{\$} and {\$}n{\$} the orbital mean motion of the binary and of the circumbinary body, respectively, there is an entirely new family of spin-orbit resonances at the frequencies {\$}n\backslashpm k\backslashnu/2{\$}, where {\$}\backslashnu = n{\_}b - n{\$}, and {\$}k{\$} is an integer. In addition, when the natural rotational libration frequency has the same magnitude as {\$}\backslashnu{\$}, the individual resonances overlap and the rotation becomes chaotic. We apply these results to the small satellites in the Pluto-Charon system. We conclude that the rotation of Nix and Styx can be chaotic, and that the rotation of Hydra and Kerberos is stable but not necessarily synchronous.},

We compute posterior distributions of our model parameters for each planet with all of the available JWST spectroscopic modes and several programs of combined observations and compute their effectiveness using the metric of estimated mutual information per degree of freedom.

@article{Mordasini2013,
abstract = {Context. The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet formation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important physical mechanisms during formation, namely, the structure of the accretion shock and, even more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or gravitational instability).  Aims: Our aim is to study the impact of the core mass on the post-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core accretion with a supercritical accretion shock that radiates all accretion shock energy (cold accretion).  Methods: For this, we conduct self-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets with masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120 Earth masses in the 1D spherically symmetric approximation.  Results: As the main result, it is found that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant planets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase in the core mass by a factor 6 results in an increase in the post-formation luminosity of a 10-Jovian mass planet by a factor 120, indicating a dependency as mcore2-3. Due to this dependency, there is no single well-defined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range, even for completely cold accretion. For massive cores ( 100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core accretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start scenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the mechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or during gas runaway accretion and that they sink during this time deep into the planet.  Conclusions: We make no claims about whether such massive cores can actually form in giant planets especially at large orbital distances. But if they can form, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as the formation mechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more luminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational instability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity can also be caused, at least in principle, simply by a more massive core.},

We use several novel techniques in our data analysis, the most important of which is a new correction for the detector "ramp" variation with a double-exponential function, which performs better and is a better physical model for this detector variation. Our main scientific findings are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet flux of 2.7{\%} (68{\%} confidence); (2) the most precise set of transit times measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second planets in this system above 20{\%} of the mass of Mars in low-order mean-motion resonance at 95{\%} confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet's phase variation, finding the night side is 64{\%} as bright as the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of 17{\%} (68{\%} confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 $\mu$m causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary eclipse, confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 $\mu$m photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and 33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of this system. These results were enabled by the exquisite photometric precision of Spitzer IRAC; for repeat observations the scatter is less than 0.35 mmag over the 590 day timescale of our observations after decorrelating with detector parameters.},

abstract = {This work aims to improve the current understanding of the atmospheres of brown dwarfs, especially cold ones with spectral types T and Y, whose modeling is a current challenge. Silicate and iron clouds are believed to disappear at the photosphere at the L/T transition, but cloudless models fail to reproduce correctly the spectra of T dwarfs, advocating for the addition of more physics, e.g., other types of clouds or internal energy transport mechanisms. We use a one-dimensional radiative/convective equilibrium code ATMO to investigate this issue. This code includes both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium chemistry and solves consistently the PT structure. Included opacity sources are H2-H2, H2-He, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, NH3, K, Na, and TiO, VO if they are present in the atmosphere. We show that the spectra of Y dwarfs can be accurately reproduced with a cloudless model if vertical mixing and NH3 quenching are taken into account. T dwarf spectra still have some reddening in, e.g., J–H, compared to cloudless models. This reddening can be reproduced by slightly reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. We propose that this reduction of the stabilizing temperature gradient in these layers, leading to cooler structures, is due to the onset of fingering convection, triggered by the destabilizing impact of condensation of very thin dust.},

abstract = {Using a model for refractory clouds, a novel algorithm for handling them, and the latest gas-phase molecular opacities, we have produced a new series of L and T dwarf spectral and atmosphere models as a function of gravity and metallicity, spanning the Teff range from 2200 to 700 K. The correspondence with observed spectra and infrared colors for early and mid-L dwarfs and for mid- to late T dwarfs is good. We find that the width in infrared color-magnitude diagrams of both the T and L dwarf branches is naturally explained by reasonable variations in gravity and therefore that gravity is the ``second parameter of the L-T dwarf sequence. We investigate the dependence of theoretical dwarf spectra and color-magnitude diagrams on various cloud properties, such as particle size and cloud spatial distribution. In the region of the L → T transition, we find that no single combination of cloud particle size and gravity can be made to fit all the observed data. Our results suggest that current ignorance of detailed cloud meteorology renders ambiguous the extraction of various physical quantities such as Teff and gravity for mid-L to early T dwarfs. Nevertheless, for decreasing Teff, we capture with some accuracy the major spectral features and signatures observed. We speculate that the subdwarf branch of the L dwarfs would be narrower in effective temperature and that for low enough metallicity the L dwarfs would disappear altogether as a spectroscopic class. Furthermore, we note that the new, lower solar oxygen abundances of Allende-Prieto and coworkers produce better fits to brown dwarf data than do the older values. Finally, we discuss various issues in cloud physics and modeling and speculate on how a better correspondence between theory and observation in the problematic L → T transition region could be achieved.},

abstract = {Atmospheric chemical abundances of giant planets lead to important constraints on planetary formation and migration. Recent studies have shown that giant planets that migrate through the protoplanetary disk can accrete substantial amounts of oxygen-rich solids, leading to super-solar metallicities in the envelope and solar or sub-solar C/O ratios. Pebble accretion has been demonstrated recently to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth rates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion rates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently migrate to cold (1 AU) or hot (0.1 AU) orbits. In this work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble accretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that under the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from the envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar, while the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to become hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still acquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8. The metallicity can be substantially sub-solar (∼ 0.2 − 0.5×solar) and the C/O can even approach 1.0 if the planet accretes its envelope mostly beyond the CO 2 ice line, i.e. cold Jupiters or hot Jupiters that form far out and migrate in by scattering. Allowing for core erosion yields significantly super-solar metallicities and solar or sub-solar C/O, which can also be achieved by other means, e.g. photoevaporation and late-stage planetesimal accretion.},

abstract = {L dwarfs exhibit low-level, rotationally-modulated photometric variability generally associated with heterogeneous, cloud-covered atmospheres. The spectral character of these variations yields insight into the particle sizes and vertical structure of the clouds. Here we present the results of a high precision, ground-based, near-infrared, spectral monitoring study of two mid-type L dwarfs that have variability reported in the literature, 2MASS J08354256-0819237 and 2MASS J18212815+1414010, using the SpeX instrument on the Infrared Telescope Facility. By simultaneously observing a nearby reference star, we achieve {\textless}0.15{\%} per-band sensitivity in relative brightness changes across the 0.9--2.4um bandwidth. We find that 2MASS J0835-0819 exhibits marginal ({\textless} {\~{}}0.5{\%} per band) variability with no clear spectral dependence, while 2MASS J1821+1414 varies by up to +/-1.5{\%} at 0.9 um, with the variability amplitude declining toward longer wavelengths. The latter result extends the variability trend observed in prior HST/WFC3 spectral monitoring of 2MASS J1821+1414, and we show that the full 0.9-2.4 um variability amplitude spectrum can be reproduced by Mie extinction from dust particles with a log-normal particle size distribution with a median radius of 0.24 um. We do not detect statistically significant phase variations with wavelength. The different variability behavior of 2MASS J0835-0819 and 2MASS J1821+1414 suggests dependencies on viewing angle and/or overall cloud content, underlying factors that can be examined through a broader survey.},

abstract = {Brown dwarfs and giant gas extrasolar planets have cold atmospheres with a rich chemical compositions from which mineral cloud particles form. Their properties, like particle sizes and material composition, vary with height, and the mineral cloud particles are charged due to triboelectric processes in such dynamic atmospheres. The dynamics of the atmospheric gas is driven by the irradiating host star and/or by the rotation of the objects that changes during its lifetime. Thermal gas ionisation in these ultra-cool but dense atmospheres allows electrostatic interactions and magnetic coupling of a substantial atmosphere volume. Combined with a strong magnetic field {\$}\backslashgg B{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Earth{\}}{\$}, a chromosphere and aurorae might form as suggested by radio and X-ray observations of brown dwarfs. Non-equilibrium processes like cosmic ray ionisation and discharge processes in clouds will increase the local pool of free electrons in the gas. Cosmic rays and lighting discharges also alter the composition of the local atmospheric gas such that tracer molecules might be identified. Cosmic rays affect the atmosphere through air showers which was modelled with a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to be able to visualise their spacial extent. Given a certain degree of thermal ionisation of the atmospheric gas, we suggest that electron attachment to charge mineral cloud particles is too inefficient to cause an electrostatic disruption of the cloud particles. Cloud particles will therefore not be destroyed by Coulomb explosion for the local temperature in the collisional dominated brown dwarf and giant gas planet atmospheres. However, the cloud particles are destroyed electrostatically in regions with strong gas ionisation. The potential size of such cloud holes would, however, be too small and might occur too far inside the cloud to mimic the effect of, e.g., magnetic field induced star spots.},

abstract = {Recent observations and analysis of small exoplanets have found that rocky planets like the Earth only have radii up to 1.5-2 R  . Two general hypotheses exist for the cause of the dichotomy between rocky and gas-enveloped planets (or possible water worlds): either small planets do not easily form thick atmospheres, or the thick atmospheres on small planets easily escape driven by x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) emissions from young parent stars. Here we show that a cutoff between rocky and gas-enveloped planets due to hydrodynamic escape is most likely to occur at a mean radius of 1.760.38 (2) R  around Sun-like stars. We examine the limit in rocky planet radii predicted by hydrodynamic escape across a wide range of possible model inputs using 10,000 parameter combinations drawn randomly from plausible parameter ranges. We find a cutoff between rocky and gas-enveloped planets that agrees with the observed cutoff. The large cross-section available for XUV absorption in the extremely distended primitive atmospheres of low mass planets results in complete loss of atmospheres during the {\~{}}100 Myr phase of stellar XUV saturation. In contrast, more massive planets have less distended atmospheres and less escape, and so retain thick atmospheres through XUV saturation and then indefinitely as the XUV and escape fluxes drop over time. The agreement between our model and exoplanet data leads us to conclude that hydrodynamic escape plausibly explains the observed upper limit on rocky planet size.},

abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic analysis of rotational velocities in 714 M dwarf stars observed by the SDSS III Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. We use a template fitting technique to estimate v sin i while simultaneously estimating log g, [M/H], and T eff. We conservatively estimate that our detection limit is 8 km s −1. We compare our results to M dwarf rotation studies in the literature based on both spectroscopic and photometric measurements. Like other authors, we find an increase in the fraction of rapid rotators with decreasing stellar temperature, exemplified by a sharp increase in rotation near the M4 transition to fully convective stellar interiors, which is consistent with the hypothesis that fully convective stars are unable to shed angular momentum as efficiently as those with radiative cores. We compare a sample of targets observed both by APOGEE and the MEarth transiting planet survey and find no cases were the measured v sin i and rotation period are physically inconsistent, requiring sin i {\textgreater} 1. We compare our spectroscopic results to the fraction of rotators inferred from photometric surveys and find that while the results are broadly consistent, the photometric surveys exhibit a smaller fraction of rotators beyond the M4 transition by a factor of ∼ 2. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. Given our detection limit, our results are consistent with a bi-modal distribution in rotation that is seen in photometric surveys.},

abstract = {Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we observed a transit at 3.6um of KELT-11b (Pepper et al. 2017). We also observed three partial transits from the ground. We simultaneously fit these observations, ground-based photometry from Pepper et al. (2017), radial velocity data from Pepper et al. (2017), and an SED model utilizing catalog magnitudes and the Hipparcos parallax to the system. The only significant difference between our results and Pepper et al. (2017) is that we find the orbital period is shorter by 37 seconds, {\$}4.73610\backslashpm0.00003{\$} vs. {\$}4.73653\backslashpm0.00006{\$} days, and we measure a transit center time of BJD{\_}TDB {\$}2457483.4310\backslashpm0.0007{\$}, which is 42 minutes earlier than predicted. Using our new photometry, we measure the density of the star KELT-11 to 4{\%}. By combining the parallax and catalog magnitudes of the system, we are able to measure KELT-11b's radius essentially empirically. Coupled with the stellar density, this gives a parallactic mass and radius of {\$}1.8\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and {\$}2.9\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm R{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, which are each approximately {\$}1\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$} higher than the adopted model-estimated mass and radius. If we conduct the same fit using the expected parallax uncertainty from the final Gaia data release, this difference increases to {\$}4\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$}. This demonstrates the role that precise Gaia parallaxes, coupled with simultaneous photometric, RV, and SED fitting, can play in determining stellar and planetary parameters. With high precision photometry of transiting planets and high precision Gaia parallaxes, the parallactic mass and radius uncertainties of stars become 1{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively. TESS is expected to discover 60 to 80 systems where these measurements will be possible. These parallactic mass and radius measurements have uncertainties small enough that they may provide observational input into the stellar models themselves.},

Here we investigate a number of factors related to the potential habitability of Proxima b and its ability to maintain liquid water on its surface. We set the stage by estimating the current high-energy irradiance of the planet and show that the planet currently receives 30 times more EUV radiation than Earth and 250 times more X-rays. We compute the time evolution of the star's spectrum, which is essential for modeling the flux received over Proxima b's lifetime. We also show that Proxima b's obliquity is likely null and its spin is either synchronous or in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, depending on the planet's eccentricity and level of triaxiality. Next we consider the evolution of Proxima b's water inventory. We use our spectral energy distribution to compute the hydrogen loss from the planet with an improved energy-limited escape formalism. Despite the high level of stellar activity we find that Proxima b is likely to have lost less than an Earth ocean's worth of hydrogen before it reached the HZ 100-200 Myr after its formation. The largest uncertainty in our work is the initial water budget, which is not constrained by planet formation models. We conclude that Proxima b is a viable candidate habitable planet.},

The TRENDS high-contrast imaging survey has recently discovered a (mass/age/metallicity) benchmark brown dwarf orbiting the nearby (d=18.69+/-0.19 pc), G8V/K0V star HD 4747. We have acquired follow-up spectroscopic measurements of HD 4747 B using the Gemini Planet Imager to study its spectral type, effective temperature, surface gravity, and cloud properties. Observations obtained in the H-band and K1-band recover the companion and reveal that it is near the L/T transition (T1+/-2). Fitting atmospheric models to the companion spectrum, we find strong evidence for the presence of clouds. However, spectral models cannot satisfactorily fit the complete data set: while the shape of the spectrum can be well-matched in individual filters, a joint fit across the full passband results in discrepancies that are a consequence of the inherent color of the brown dwarf. We also find a {\$}2\backslashsigma{\$} tension in the companion mass, age, and surface gravity when comparing to evolutionary models. These results highlight the importance of using benchmark objects to study "secondary effects" such as metallicity, non-equilibrium chemistry, cloud parameters, electron conduction, non-adiabatic cooling, and other subtleties affecting emergent spectra. As a new L/T transition benchmark, HD 4747 B warrants further investigation into the modeling of cloud physics using higher resolution spectroscopy across a broader range of wavelengths, polarimetric observations, and continued Doppler radial velocity and astrometric monitoring.},

abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large datasets. Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this purpose but, since the computational cost scales as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to relatively small datasets. In this paper, we present a method for Gaussian Process modeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators - providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice - but we also demonstrate that it is effective in many other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method, the details of the implementation, and a comparison to existing scalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is flexible, fast, and most importantly, interpretable, with a wide range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

abstract = {Currently, the analysis of transmission spectra is the most successful technique to probe the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres. But the accuracy of these measurements is constrained by observational limitations and the diversity of possible atmospheric compositions. Here we show the UV-VIS-IR transmission spectrum of Jupiter, as if it were a transiting exoplanet, obtained by observing one of its satellites, Ganymede, while passing through Jupiter's shadow i.e., during a solar eclipse from Ganymede. The spectrum shows strong extinction due to the presence of clouds (aerosols) and haze in the atmosphere, and strong absorption features from CH4. More interestingly, the comparison with radiative transfer models reveals a spectral signature, which we attribute here to a Jupiter stratospheric layer of crystalline H2O ice. The atomic transitions of Na are also present. These results are relevant for the modeling and interpretation of giant transiting exoplanets. They also open a new technique to explore the atmospheric composition of the upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere.},

abstract = {It has been becoming clear that the atmospheres of the young, self-luminous extrasolar giant planets imaged to date are dusty. Planets with dusty atmospheres may exhibit detectable amounts of linear polarization in the near-infrared, as has been observed from some field L dwarfs. The asymmetry required in the thermal radiation field to produce polarization may arise either from the rotation-induced oblateness or from surface inhomogeneities, such as partial cloudiness. While it is not possible at present to predict the extent to which atmospheric dynamics on a given planet may produce surface inhomogeneities substantial enough to produce net non-zero disc-integrated polarization, the contribution of rotation-induced oblateness can be estimated. Using a self-consistent, spatially homogeneous atmospheric model and a multiple scattering polarization formalism for this class of exoplanets, we show that polarization of the order of 1 per cent may arise due to the rotation-induced oblateness of the planets. The degree of polarization for cloudy planets should peak at the same wavelengths at which the planets are brightest in the near-infrared. The observed polarization may be even higher if surface inhomogeneities exist and play a significant role. Polarized radiation from self-luminous gas giant exoplanets, if detected, provides an additional tool to characterize these young planets and a new method to constrain their surface gravity and masses.},

We use it to (re)derive the NIR spectral types, luminosities and physical parameters of the targets, and to test (BT-SETTL, DRIFT-PHOENIX) atmospheric models. We derive infrared spectral types L0+-1, L0+-1, M9.5+-0.5, M9.5+-0.5, M9.25+-0.25, M8+0.5-0.75, and M8.5+-0.5 for AB Pic b, Cha J110913-773444, USco CTIO 108B, GSC 08047-00232 B, DH Tau B, CT Cha b, and HR7329B, respectively. BT-SETTL and DRIFT-PHOENIX models yield close Teff and log g estimates for each sources. The models seem to evidence a 600-300+600 K drop of the effective temperature at the M-L transition. Assuming the former temperatures are correct, we derive new mass estimates which confirm that DH Tau B, USco CTIO 108B, AB Pic b, KPNO Tau 4, OTS 44, and Cha1109 lay inside or at the boundary of the planetary mass range. We combine the empirical luminosities of the M9.5-L0 sources to the Teff to derive semi-empirical radii estimates that do not match "hot-start" evolutionary models predictions at 1-3 Myr. We use complementary data to demonstrate that atmospheric models are able to reproduce the combined optical and infrared spectral energy distribution, together with the near-infrared spectra of these sources simultaneously. But the models still fail to represent the dominant features in the optical. This issue casts doubts on the ability of these models to predict correct effective temperatures from near-infrared spectra alone. We advocate the use of photometric and spectroscopic data covering a broad range of wavelengths to study the properties of very low mass young companions to be detected with the planet imagers (Subaru/SCExAO, LBT/LMIRCam, Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE).},

abstract = {There have been many proposed explanations for the larger-than-expected radii of some transiting hot Jupiters, including either stellar or orbital energy deposition deep in the atmosphere or deep in the interior. In this paper, we explore the important influences on hot-Jupiter radius evolution of (1) additional heat sources in the high atmosphere, the deep atmosphere, and deep in the convective interior; (2) consistent cooling of the deep interior through the planetary dayside, nightside, and poles; (3) the degree of heat redistribution to the nightside; and (4) the presence of an upper atmosphere absorber inferred to produce anomalously hot upper atmospheres and inversions in some close-in giant planets. In particular, we compare the radius expansion effects of atmospheric and deep-interior heating at the same power levels and derive the power required to achieve a given radius increase when night-side cooling is incorporated. We find that models that include consistent day/night cooling are more similar to isotropically irradiated models when there is more heat redistributed from the dayside to the nightside. In addition, we consider the efficacy of ohmic heating in the atmosphere and/or convective interior in inflating hot Jupiters. Among our conclusions are that (1) the most highly irradiated planets cannot stably have uB  10 km s–1 G over a large fraction of their daysides, where u is the zonal wind speed and B is the dipolar magnetic field strength in the atmosphere, and (2) that ohmic heating cannot in and of itself lead to a runaway in planet radius.},

abstract = {The signatures of planets hosted by M dwarfs are more readily detected with transit photometry and radial velocity methods than those of planets around larger stars. Recently, transit photometry was used to discover seven planets orbiting the late-M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Three of TRAPPIST-1's planets fall in the Habitable Zone, a region where liquid water could exist on the planetary surface given appropriate planetary conditions. We aim to investigate the habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets by studying the star's activity and its effect on the planets. We analyze previously-published space-and ground-based light curves and show the photometrically-determined rotation period of TRAPPIST-1 appears to vary over time due to complicated, evolving surface activity. The dramatic changes of the surface of TRAPPIST-1 suggest that rotation periods determined photometrically may not be reliable for this and similarly active stars. While the activity of the star is low, we use the premise of the " cosmic shoreline " to provide evidence that the TRAPPIST-1 environment has potentially led to the erosion of possible planetary atmospheres by extreme ultraviolet stellar emission.},

abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presents the opportunity to transform our understanding of planets and the origins of life by revealing the atmospheric compositions, structures, and dynamics of transiting exoplanets in unprecedented detail. However, the high-precision, time-series observations required for such investigations have unique technical challenges, and prior experience with other facilities indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST becomes operational. In this paper we describe the science objectives and detailed plans of the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which is a recently approved program for JWST observations early in Cycle 1. The goal of this project, for which the obtained data will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the acquisition and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting exoplanet observations with JWST, while also providing a compelling set of representative datasets that will enable immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet Community ERS Program will exercise the time-series modes of all four JWST instruments that have been identified as the consensus highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting planet characterization geometries (transits, eclipses, and phase curves), and target planets with host stars that span an illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations in this program were defined through an inclusive and transparent process that had participation from JWST instrument experts and international leaders in transiting exoplanet studies. Community engagement in the project will be centered on a two-phase Data Challenge that culminates with the delivery of planetary spectra, time-series instrument performance reports, and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the agenda for Cycle 2 of the JWST mission.},

abstract = {Pixel design is a key part of image sensor design. After deciding on pixel architecture, a fundamental tradeoff is made to select pixel size. A small pixel size is desirable because it results in a smaller die size and/or higher spatial resolution; a large pixel size is desirable because it results in higher dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio. Given these two ways to improve image quality and given a set of process and imaging constraints an optimal pixel size exists. It is difficult, however, to analytically determine the optimal pixel size, because the choice depends on many factors, including the sensor parameters, imaging optics and the human perception of image quality. This paper describes a methodology, using a camera simulator and image quality metrics, for determining the optimal pixel size. The methodology is demonstrated for APS implemented in CMOS processes down to O.18jt technology. For a typical O.35p CMOS technology the optimal pixel size is found to be approximately 6.5,am at fill factor of 30{\%}. It is shown that the optimal pixel size scales with technology, but at slower rate than the technology itself.},

In the coming years, many more disks will be mapped with ALMA at similar resolution. Interpreting the results in terms of the properties and quantities of the emitting dusty material is, however, a very non-trivial task. This is in part due to the uncertainty in the dust opacities, an uncertainty which is not likely to be resolved any time soon. It is also partly due to the fact that, as the DSHARP survey has shown, these disk often contain regions of intermediate to high optical depth, even at millimeter wavelengths and at relatively large radius in the disk. This makes the interpretation challenging, in particular if the grains are large and have a large albedo. On the other hand, the highly structured features seen in the DSHARP survey, of which strong indications were already seen in earlier observations, provide a unique opportunity to study the dust growth and dynamics. To provide continuity within the DSHARP project, its follow-up projects, and projects by other teams interested in these data, we present here the methods and opacity choices used within the DSHARP collaboration to link the measured intensity {\$}I{\_}\backslashnu{\$} to dust surface density {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}d{\$}.},

In this paper, we present a new method to estimate the absolute age of a globular cluster from observations of its brown dwarfs. The transition region between the end of the main sequence and the brown dwarf regime is characterized by a dearth of objects as function of magnitude. The brightest of the cooling brown dwarfs is easily identified by an increase in density in the color-magnitude diagram as you go fainter in magnitudes, and these brightest brown dwarfs get fainter with age. By identifying the brightest brown dwarfs, it is thus possible to determine the age of a globular cluster within a 1 Gyr precision with four-sigma confidence. This new method, which is independent of current methods of age estimation and which does not rely on the knowledge of the cluster's distance from Earth, will become feasible thanks to the high spatial resolution and incredible infrared sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope.},

abstract = {The spectrum of an exoplanet reveals the physical, chemical, and biological processes that have shaped its history and govern its future. However, observations of exoplanet spectra are complicated by the overwhelming glare of their host stars. This review chapter focuses on high resolution spectroscopy (HRS) (R = 25, 000 − 100, 000), which helps to disentangle and isolate the exoplanet's spectrum. At high spectral resolution, molecular features are resolved into a dense forest of individual lines in a pattern that is unique for a given molecule. For close-in planets, the spectral lines undergo large Doppler-shifts during the planet's orbit, while the host star and Earth's spectral features remain essentially stationary, enabling a velocity separation of the planet. For slower-moving, wide-orbit planets, HRS, aided by high contrast imaging, instead isolates their spectra using their spatial separation. The lines in the exoplanet spectrum are detected by comparing them with high resolution spectra from atmospheric modelling codes; essentially a form of fingerprinting for exoplanet atmospheres. This measures the planet's orbital velocity , and helps define its true mass and orbital inclination. Consequently, HRS can detect both transiting and non-transiting planets. It also simultaneously characterizes the planet's atmosphere due to its sensitivity to the depth, shape, and position of the planet's spectral lines. These are altered by the planet's atmospheric composition, structure, clouds, and dynamics, including day-tonight winds and its rotation period. This chapter describes the HRS technique in detail, highlighting its successes in exoplanet detection and characterization, and concludes with the future prospects of using HRS to identify biomarkers on nearby rocky worlds, and map features in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets.},

The observations achieve a sensitivity of 17 µJy and a resolution of 0.28 arcsec (2.1 au at a distance of 7.66 pc), which are the highest resolution observations to date of the millimetre grains in Fomalhaut's main debris ring. The ring is tightly constrained to 139 +2 −3 au with a FWHM of 13 ± 3 au, following a Gaussian profile. The millimetre spectral index is constrained to $\alpha$ mm = −2.73 ± 0.13. We explore fitting debris disc models in the image plane, as well as fitting models using visibility data directly. The results are compared and the potential advantages/disadvantages of each approach are discussed. The detected central emission is indistinguishable from a point source, with a most probable flux of 0.90±0.12 mJy (including calibration uncertainties). This implies that any inner debris structure, as was inferred from far-Infrared observations, must con-tribute little to the total central emission. Moreover, the stellar flux is less than 70{\%} of that predicted by extrapolating a black body from the constrained stellar photosphere temperature. This result emphasizes that unresolved inner debris components cannot be fully characterized until the behaviour of the host star's intrinsic stellar emission at millimetre wavelengths is properly understood.},

The brown dwarf 2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5) detected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the Arecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100{\%}-polarized radio pulses similar to those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse periodicity; previous VLA observations detected quiescent emission a factor of {\~{}}100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we present 14 hours of Very Large Array observations of this object that reveal a series of pulses at {\~{}}6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the pulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared to the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of {\~{}}1.77 hr and identify it with the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in a late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10 GHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2M 1047+21 reaches at least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly-rotating radio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those of other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields and radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this kind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and magnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both theories and observational data are currently scarce.

Prototypes of the new “L dwarf” and “T dwarf” classes were first found in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, with a flood of new discoveries occurring in the late 1990s with the advent of deep, large-area, digital sky surveys. Over four hundred and fifty L and T dwarfs are now cataloged. This review concentrates on the spectroscopic properties of these objects, beginning with the establishment of classification schemes rooted in the MK Process. The resulting grid of spectral types is then used as a tool to ferret out the underlying physics. The temperature ranges covered by these spectral types, the complex chemical processes responsible for the shape of their emergent spectra, their nature as either true stars or brown dwarfs, and their number density in the Galaxy are discussed. Two promising avenues for future research are also explored: the extension of the classification system to three dimen...},

For a range of plausible masses and interior structures, we find upper limits on the intrinsic Teff, from {\~{}}35-50 K for masses of 5-20 M{\_}Earth. Possible planetary radii could readily span from 3 to 6 R{\_}Earth depending on the mass fraction of any H/He envelope. We model the atmospheric temperature structure and spectra. Given its cold temperature, the planet encounters significant methane condensation, which dramatically alters the atmosphere away from simple Neptune-like expectations. We find the atmosphere is strongly depleted in molecular absorption at visible wavelengths, suggesting a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere with a high geometric albedo of 0.75. We highlight two diagnostics for the atmosphere's temperature structure, the first being the value of the methane mixing ratio above the methane cloud. The second is the wavelength at which cloud scattering can be seen, which yields the cloud-top pressure. Surface reflection may be seen if the atmosphere is thin. Due to collision-induced opacity of H2 in the infrared, the planet would be extremely blue (instead of red) in the shortest wavelength WISE colors if methane is depleted, and would, in some cases, exist on the verge of detectability by WISE. For a range of models, thermal fluxes from {\~{}}3-5 microns are {\~{}}20 orders of magnitude larger than blackbody expectations. We report a search of the AllWISE Source Catalog for Planet Nine, but find no detection.},

abstract = {Surveys of young star-forming regions have discovered a growing population of planetary-mass ({\textless}13 M Jup) companions around young stars 1 . There is an ongoing debate as to whether these companions formed like planets (that is, from the circumstellar disk) 2 , or if they represent the low-mass tail of the star-formation process 3 . In this study, we utilize high-resolution spectroscopy to measure rotation rates of three young (2–300 Myr) planetary-mass companions and combine these measurements with published rotation rates for two additional companions 4,5 to provide a picture of the spin distribution of these objects. We compare this distribution to complementary rotation-rate measurements for six brown dwarfs with masses {\textless}20 M Jup, and show that these distributions are indistinguishable. This suggests that either these two populations formed via the same mechanism, or that processes regulating rotation rates are independent of formation mechanism. We find that rotation rates for both populations are well below their break-up velocities and do not evolve significantly during the first few hundred million years after the end of accretion. This suggests that rotation rates are set during the late stages of accretion, possibly by interactions with a circumplanetary disk. This result has important implications for our understanding of the processes regulating the angular momentum evolution of young planetary-mass objects, and of the physics of gas accretion and disk coupling in the planetary-mass regime.},

abstract = {The formation of planets strongly depends on the total amount as well as on the spatial distribution of solids in protoplanetary disks. Thanks to the improvements in resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA, measurements of the surface density of mm-sized grains are now possible on large samples of disks. Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to inform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation. We analyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus star forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine physical properties such as the dust surface density, the disk mass and size and to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations directly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890 micron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out of 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical properties. The sample covers stellar masses between {\~{}}0.1 and {\~{}}2 Solar masses, and we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar parameters. We find, instead, a correlation between the integrated sub-mm flux (a proxy for the disk mass) and the exponential cut-off radii (a proxy of the disk size) of the Lupus disks. Comparing these results with observations at similar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature and scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are generally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance. Considering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to tentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous spreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.},

In the present work, we further investigate the previously reported haze phenomenon in more detail using additional Framing Camera images. We demonstrate that the light scattering behavior at the central floor of Occator is different compared to a typical cerean surface and is likely inconsistent with a pure solid surface scatterer. The identified deviation is best explained by an additional component to the scattered light of the surface, i.e., a haze layer.

abstract = {We present high-quality, medium-resolution X-shooter/VLT spectra in the range 300-2500 nm for a sample of 12 very low mass stars in the $\sigma$ Orionis cluster. The sample includes eight stars with evidence of disks from Spitzer and four without disks, with masses ranging from 0.08 to 0.3 M⊙. The aim of this first paper is to investigate the reliability of the many accretion tracers currently used to measure the mass accretion rate in low-mass young stars and the accuracy of the correlations between these secondary tracers (mainly accretion line luminosities) found in the literature. We use our spectra to measure the accretion luminosity from the continuum excess emission in the UV and visual; the derived mass accretion rates range from 10-9 M⊙ yr-1 down to 5 × 10-11 M⊙ yr-1, allowing us to investigate the behavior of the accretion-driven emission lines in very low mass accretion rate regimes. We compute the luminosity of ten accretion-driven emission lines from the UV to the near-IR, which are all obtained simultaneously. In general, most of the secondary tracers correlate well with the accretion luminosity derived from the continuum excess emission. We recompute the relationships between the accretion luminosities and the line luminosities, and we confirm the validity of the correlations given in the literature, with the possible exception of H$\alpha$. Metallic lines, such as the CaII IR triplet or the Na I line at 589.3 nm, show a larger dispersion. When looking at individual objects, we find that the hydrogen recombination lines, from the UV to the near-IR, give good and consistent measurements of Lacc that often better agree than the uncertainties introduced by the adopted correlations. The average Lacc derived from several hydrogen lines, measured simultaneously, have a much reduced error. This suggests that some of the spread in the literature correlations may be due to the use of nonsimultaneous observations of lines and continuum. Three stars in our sample deviate from this behavior, and we discuss them individually. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile.

abstract = {Interpreting the spectra of brown dwarfs is key to determining the fundamental physical and chemical processes occurring in their atmospheres. Powerful Bayesian atmospheric retrieval tools have recently been applied to both exoplanet and brown dwarf spectra to tease out the thermal structures and molecular abundances to understand those processes. In this manuscript we develop a significantly upgraded retrieval method and apply it to the SpeX spectral library data of two benchmark late T-dwarfs, Gl 570D and HD 3651B, to establish the validity of our upgraded forward model parameterization and Bayesian estimator. Our retrieved metallicities, gravities, and effective temperatures are consistent with the metallicity and presumed ages of the systems. We add the carbon-to-oxygen ratio as a new dimension to benchmark systems and find good agreement between carbon-to-oxygen ratios derived in the brown dwarfs and the host stars. Furthermore, we have for the first time unambiguously determined the presence of ammonia in the low-resolution spectra of these two late Tdwarfs. We also show that the retrieved results are not significantly impacted by the possible presence of clouds, though some quantities are significantly impacted by uncertainties in photometry. This investigation represents a watershed study in establishing the utility of atmospheric retrieval approaches on brown dwarf spectra.},

It has the potential to interfere with astronomical surveys requiring precision photometry, astrometry and/or shape measurement. We posit a mechanism whereby charge is captured by traps exposed to carriers as the depletion width shrinks when photo-generated charge accumulates on the electrically isolated photodiode. After the depletion width is reestablished by resetting the diode, trapped charge is slowly released, appearing to be a signal during the subsequent exposure(s).

They find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths provides a metric that can distinguish between different atmospheric types. Significantly, strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets, while the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes, strongly arguing against primordial water depletion during formation, and indicating that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures. These results clarify the diversity seen in hot Jupiters and illustrate the interplay of clouds, hazes and metallicity in exoplanet atmospheres.},

abstract = {A planet's emission spectrum contains information about atmospheric composition and structure. We compare the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of blackbody fits and idealized spectral retrieval fits for the 44 planets with published eclipse measurements in multiple thermal wavebands, mostly obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The evidence for spectral features depends on eclipse depth uncertainties. Spitzer has proven capable of eclipse precisions better than 1E-4 when multiple eclipses are analyzed simultaneously, but this feat has only been performed four times. It is harder to self-calibrate photometry when a single occultation is reduced and analyzed in isolation; we find that such measurements have not passed the test of repeatability. Single-eclipse measurements either have an uncertainty floor of 5E-4, or their uncertainties have been underestimated by a factor of 3. If one adopts these empirical uncertainties for single-eclipse measurements, then the evidence for molecular features all but disappears: blackbodies have better BIC than spectral retrieval for all planets, save HD 189733b, and the few planets poorly fit by blackbodies are also poorly fit by self-consistent radiative transfer models. This suggests that the features in extant broadband emission spectra are due to astrophysical and instrumental noise rather than molecular bands. Claims of stratospheric inversions, disequilibrium chemistry, and high C/O ratios based solely on photometry are premature. We recommend that observers be cautious of error estimates from self-calibration of small data sets, and that modelers compare the evidence for spectral models to that of simpler models such as blackbodies.},

abstract = {The primordial internal structures of gas giant planets are unknown. Often giant planets are modeled under the assumption that they are adiabatic, convective, and homogeneously mixed, but this is not necessarily correct. In this work, we present the first self-consistent calculation of convective transport of both heat and material as the planets evolve. We examine how planetary evolution depends on the initial composition and its distribution, whether the internal structure changes with time, and if so, how it affects the evolution. We consider various primordial distributions, different compositions, and different mixing efficiencies and follow the distribution of heavy elements in a Jupiter-mass planet as it evolves. We show that a heavy-element core cannot be eroded by convection if there is a sharp compositional change at the core-envelope boundary. If the heavy elements are initially distributed within the planet according to some compositional gradient, mixing occurs in the outer regions resulting in a compositionally homogeneous outer envelope. Mixing of heavy materials that are injected in a convective gaseous envelope are found to mix efficiently. Our work demonstrates that the primordial internal structure of a giant planet plays a substantial role in determining its long-term evolution and that giant planets can have non-adiabatic interiors. These results emphasize the importance of coupling formation, evolution, and internal structure models of giant planets self-consistently.},

abstract = {A computer-based catalogue of UBVRI photoelectric photometry of T Tauri stars and their earlier type analogs has been compiled. It presently includes over 10 000 entries on 80 stars and will be updated on a regular basis; it is available on Internet. The catalogue is used to analyze the sometimes bizarre light variations of pre-main-sequence stars on time scales of days to months in an attempt to illuminate the nature and causes of the phenomenon. It is useful in discussing their light variations to divide the stars into three groups according to their spectra. These are: weak T Tauri stars (WTTS; spectral class later than K0 and WH-alpha less than 10 A, classical T Tauri stars (CTTS; spectral class later than K0 and WH-alpha greater than 10 A), and early type T Tauri stars (ETTS; spectral class of K0 or earlier). Three distinct types of variability are displayed by stars in the catalogue. Type I variations are periodic in VRI and undoubtedly caused by rotational modulation of a star with an asymmetric distribution of cool spots on its surface. Irregular flare activity is sometimes seen on such stars in U and B. Type I variations are easiest to see on WTTS but are clearly present on CTTS and ETTS as well. Type II variations are caused by hot 'spots' or zones and, it is argued, result from changes in the excess or 'veiling' continuum commonly attributed to an accretion boundary layer or impact zone of a magnetically channeled accretion flow. This type of variation is seen predominantly or solely in CTTS. A sub-category, designated Type IIp, consists of stars which display periodic variations caused by hot spots. Whereas cool spots may last for hundreds or thousands of rotations, hot spots appear to come and go on a much shorter time scale. This suggests that both unsteady accretion and rotation of the star contribute to Type II variations. It is shown that a third type of variation exists among ETTS, including stars as early as A type. UX Ori is a typical example and we call these Type III variables or UXors. Their distinguishing characteristic is that they can display very large amplitudes (exceeding 2.8 mag in V) while showing little or no evidence for a veiling continuum or any substantial change in their photospheric spectra. If Type III variations are caused by changes in accretion luminosity, then boundary layers or impact zones in ETTS must be much different from CTTS which, of course, is possible since mass accretion rates are probably much higher. However, the leading hypothesis for explaining Type III variations is variable obscuration by circumstellar dust. {\textless}It is argued that the putative dust clumps causing such variations cannot be confined to a disk; otherwise UXors would be rare. {\&}Perhaps magnetic effects are involved in levitating accreting dust out of the plane, as has been suggested for CTTS, or perhaps we are witnessing continuing infall of clumps from placental clouds. A third possibility is that dust may be condensing in an outflow.},

abstract = {We analyze the evolution of the potentially habitable planet Proxima Centauri b to identify environmental factors that affect its long-term habitability. We consider physical processes acting on size scales ranging from the galactic to the stellar system to the planet's core. We find that there is a significant probability that Proxima Centauri has had encounters with its companion stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, that are close enough to destabilize an extended planetary system. If the system has an additional planet, as suggested by the discovery data, then it may perturb planet b's eccentricity and inclination, possibly driving those parameters to non-zero values, even in the presence of strong tidal damping. We also model the internal evolution of the planet, evaluating the roles of different radiogenic abundances and tidal heating and find that magnetic field generation is likely for billions of years. We find that if planet b formed in situ, then it experienced 169 +/- 13 million years in a runaway greenhouse as the star contracted during its formation. This early phase could remove up to 5 times as much water as in the modern Earth's oceans, possibly producing a large abiotic oxygen atmosphere. On the other hand, if Proxima Centauri b formed with a substantial hydrogen atmosphere (0.01 - 1{\%} of the planet's mass), then this envelope could have shielded the water long enough for it to be retained before being blown off itself. After modeling this wide range of processes we conclude that water retention during the host star's pre-main sequence phase is the biggest obstacle for Proxima b's habitability. These results are all obtained with a new software package called VPLANET.},

The optical spectral types of the brown dwarfs range from M5.5 to M8.75, though two have near-IR spectral types of early L dwarfs. We report new accretion rates derived from excess Balmer continuum emission for the low-mass stars TW Hya and Hen 3-600A and the brown dwarfs 2MASS J12073347-3932540, UScoCTIO 128, SSSPM J1102-3431, USco J160606.29-233513.3, DENIS-P J160603.9-205644, and Oph J162225-240515B, and upper limits on accretion for the low-mass star Hen 3-600B and the brown dwarfs UScoCTIO 112, Oph J162225-240515A, and USco J160723.82-221102.0. For the six brown dwarfs in our sample that are faintest at short wavelengths, the accretion luminosity or upper limit is measurable only when the image is binned over large wavelength intervals. This method extends our sensitivity to accretion rate down to {\~{}}10-13 Msunyr-1 for brown dwarfs. Since the ability to measure an accretion rate from excess Balmer continuum emission depends on the contrast between excess continuum emission and the underlying photosphere, for objects with earlier spectral types the upper limit on accretion rate is much higher. Absolute uncertainties in our accretion rate measurements of {\~{}}3-5 include uncertainty in accretion models, brown dwarf masses, and distance. The accretion rate of 2 × 10-12 M sun yr-1 onto 2MASS J12073347-3932540 is within 15{\%} of two previous measurements, despite large changes in the H$\alpha$ flux.},

abstract = {Aims.The aim of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass accretion rate in a large, complete sample of objects in the core of the star forming region $\rho$ Oph. Methods: .The sample includes most of the objects (104 out of 111) with evidence of a circumstellar disk from mid-infrared photometry; it covers a stellar mass range from about 0.03 to 3 M{\_}⊙ and it is complete to a limiting mass of  0.05 M{\_}⊙. We used J and K-band spectra to derive the mass accretion rate of each object from the intensity of the hydrogen recombination lines, Pa$\beta$ or Br$\gamma$. For comparison, we also obtained similar spectra of 35 diskless objects. Results: .The results show that emission in these lines is only seen in stars with disks, and can be used as an indicator of accretion. However, the converse does not hold, as about 50{\%} of our disk objects do not have detectable line emission. The measured accretion rates show a strong correlation with the mass of the central object (dot M{\_}acc ∝ M{\_}star1.8±0.2) and a large spread, of two orders of magnitude at least, for any interval of M{\_}star. A comparison with existing data for Taurus shows that the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least for objects more massive than ˜ 0.1 M{\_}⊙. The implications of these results are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements of their atmospheric properties that constrain the planets' origins and evolution. For example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O {\textgreater} 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than is commonly assumed for giant planets. Here we report a precise near-infrared transmission spectrum for WASP-12b based on six transit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope/ Wide Field Camera 3. We bin the data in 13 spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 to 1.67 $\mu$m and measure the transit depths to a median precision of 51 ppm. We retrieve the atmospheric properties using the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption (7$\sigma$ confidence). This detection marks the first high-confidence, spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. The retrieved 1 $\sigma$ water volume mixing ratio is between 10 −5 and 10 −2 , which is consistent with C/O {\textgreater} 1 to within 2$\sigma$. However, we also introduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for C/O and metallicity under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. With this approach, we constrain C/O to 0.5 0.3 0.2-+ at 1$\sigma$ and rule out a carbon-rich atmosphere composition (C/O {\textgreater} 1) at {\textgreater}3$\sigma$ confidence. Further observations and modeling of the planet's global thermal structure and dynamics would aid in resolving the tension between our inferred C/O and previous constraints. Our findings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data with multiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on the chemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.},

Here we report that our numerical model, when combined with experimental data found in the literature, shows that Ligeia Mare's bed is a favourable place for nitrogen exsolution. This process could produce centimeter-sized and radar-detectable bubbles.},

abstract = {Direct-imaging searches for planets reveal wide orbit planets amenable to spectroscopy, and their atmospheres represent an important comparison to the irradiated atmospheres of Hot Jupiters. Using AO integral field spectroscopy of 2M1207 b, the shape of the con- tinuum emission over the J, H,and K bands from the atmosphere of this young, planetary mass companion is measured in order to compare with atmospheric and evolutionary models, and objects of similar temperature in young clusters and the field. The 2M1207 b spectrum has the highest spectral resolution (R ∼ 300−1500) and largest wavelength coverage, including the first J-band spectrum, for this benchmark object. The high signal-to-noise of the data allow a clear identification of signatures of low surface gravity, and com- parison with a grid of AMES-Dusty models reveals a best-fit effective temperature of Teff= 1600K with a preferred surface gravity of log g= 4.5. The J-band flux is depressed relative to nearly all L-type objects, and the detailed shape of the absorption features across the H-band exhibit differences from the model predictions. The possible origins of 2M1207 b and its low luminosity are examined with the new data and analysis which suggest that extinction from a disk with large grains is a viable scenario and is preferred over scatttering off an optically thick disk. The 2M1207 b spectrum presents an important comparison for the types of features which may be present in upcoming spectra of the atmospheres of planets imaged in orbit around stellar primaries.},

The observed line ratio between the two unresolved and the third line of the He I triplet is {\$}2.8\backslashpm0.2{\$}, which strongly deviates from the value expected for an optically thin atmospheres. When interpreted in terms of absorption in the planetary atmosphere, this favors a compact helium atmosphere with an extent of only 0.2 planetary radii and a substantial column density on the order of {\$}4\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}. The observed radial velocities can be understood either in terms of atmospheric circulation with equatorial superrotation or as a sign of an asymmetric atmospheric component of evaporating material. We detect no clear signature of ongoing evaporation, like pre- or post-transit absorption, which could indicate material beyond the planetary Roche lobe, or radial velocities in excess of the escape velocity. These findings do not contradict planetary evaporation, but only show that the detected helium absorption in HD 189733 b does not trace the atmospheric layers that show pronounced escape signatures.},

abstract = {The intense irradiation received by hot Jupiters suppresses convection in the outer layers of their atmospheres and lowers their cooling rates. "Inflated" hot Jupiters, i.e., those with anomalously large transit radii, require additional sources of heat or suppressed cooling. We consider the effect of forced turbulent mixing in the radiative layer, which could be driven by atmospheric circulation or by another mechanism. Due to stable stratification in the atmosphere, forced turbulence drives a downward flux of heat. Weak turbulent mixing slows the cooling rate by this process, as if the planet were irradiated more intensely. Stronger turbulent mixing buries heat into the convective interior, provided the turbulence extends to the radiative-convective boundary. This inflates the planet until a balance is reached between the heat buried into and radiated from the interior. We also include the direct injection of heat due to the dissipation of turbulence or other effects. Such heating is already known to slow planetary cooling. We find that dissipation also enhances heat burial from mixing by lowering the threshold for turbulent mixing to drive heat into the interior. Strong turbulent mixing of heavy molecular species such as TiO may be necessary to explain stratospheric thermal inversions. We show that the amount of mixing required to loft TiO may overinflate the planet by our mechanism. This possible refutation of the TiO hypothesis deserves further study. Our inflation mechanism requires a deep stratified layer that only exists when the absorbed stellar flux greatly exceeds the intrinsic emitted flux. Thus, it would be less effective for more luminous brown dwarfs and for longer period gas giants, including Jupiter and Saturn.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic mapping of seasonally sculpted terrains on the South Polar region of Mars with the Planet Four: Terrains (P4T) online citizen science project. P4T enlists members of the general public to visually identify features in the publicly released Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CTX images. In particular, P4T volunteers are asked to identify: 1) araneiforms (including features with a central pit and radiating channels known as 'spiders'); 2) erosional depressions, troughs, mesas, ridges, and quasi-circular pits characteristic of the South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) which we collectively refer to as 'Swiss cheese terrain', and 3) craters. In this work we present the distributions of our high confidence classic spider araneiforms and Swiss cheese terrain identifications. We find no locations within our high confidence spider sample that also have confident Swiss cheese terrain identifications. Previously spiders were reported as being confined to the South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD). Our work has provided the first identification of spiders at locations outside of the SPLD, confirmed with high resolution HiRISE imaging. We find araneiforms on the Amazonian and Hesperian polar units and the Early Noachian highland units, with 75{\%} of the identified araneiform locations in our high confidence sample residing on the SPLD. With our current coverage, we cannot confirm whether these are the only geologic units conducive to araneiform formation on the Martian South Polar region. Our results are consistent with the current CO2 jet formation scenario with the process exploiting weaknesses in the surface below the seasonal CO2 ice sheet to carve araneiform channels into the regolith over many seasons. These new regions serve as additional probes of the conditions required for channel creation in the CO2 jet process. (Abridged)},

The data were collected roughly every 2 months between 2003 September and 2005 July with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Thanks to the remarkably accurate astrometry delivered by the VLBA, the absolute position of T Tau Sb could be measured with a precision typically better than about 100 $\mu$as at each of the 12 observed epochs. The trajectory of T Tau Sb on the plane of the sky could therefore be traced very precisely and was modeled as the superposition of the trigonometric parallax of the source and an accelerated proper motion. The best fit yields a distance to T Tau Sb of 147.6+/-0.6 pc. The observed positions of T Tau Sb are in good agreement with recent infrared measurements, but they seem to favor a somewhat longer orbital period than that recently reported by Duch{\^{e}}ne and coworkers for the T Tau Sa/T Tau Sb system.},

Early theoretical models predicted helium to be among the most readily detectable species in the atmospheres of exoplanets, especially in extended and escaping atmospheres 1 . Searches for helium, however, have hitherto been unsuccessful 2 . Here we report observations of helium on an exoplanet, at a confidence level of 4.5 standard deviations. We measured the near-infrared transmission spectrum of the warm gas giant 3 WASP-107b and identified the narrow absorption feature of excited metastable helium at 10,833 angstroms. The amplitude of the feature, in transit depth, is 0.049 ± 0.011 per cent in a bandpass of 98 angstroms, which is more than five times greater than what could be caused by nominal stellar chromospheric activity. This large absorption signal suggests that WASP-107b has an extended atmosphere that is eroding at a total rate of 1010 to 3 × 1011 grams per second (0.1–4 per cent of its total mass per billion years), and may have a comet-like tail of gas shaped by radiation pressure.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, b ecause they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

abstract = {Image Rotation and Subtraction (IRS) is a high-contrast imaging technique which can be used to suppress the speckles noise and facilitate the direct detection of exoplanets. IRS is different from Angular Differential Imaging (ADI), in which it will subtract a copy of the image with 180 degrees rotated around its PSF center, rather than the subtraction of the median of all of the PSF images. Since the planet itself will be rotated to the other side of the PSF, IRS does not suffer from planet self-subtraction. In this paper, we have introduced an optimization algorithm to IRS (OIRS), which can provide an extra contrast gain at small angular separations. The performance of OIRS has been demonstrated with ADI data. We then made a comparison of the signal to noise ratio (S/N) achieved by algorithms of locally optimized combination of images (LOCI) and OIRS. Finally we found that OIRS algorithm can deliver a better S/N for small angular separations.},

I compare synthetic spectral energy distributions with the handful of claimed detections of substellar-mass companions in transition disks. While observed fluxes of candidate companions are generally compatible with accreting protoplanets, challenges remain in reconciling the extended structure inferred in observed objects with the compact emission expected from protoplanets or circumplanetary disks.

abstract = {The atmosphere of a brown dwarf or extrasolar giant planet controls the spectrum of radiation emitted by the object and regulates its cooling over time. Although the study of these atmospheres has been informed by decades of experience modeling stellar and planetary atmospheres, the distinctive characteristics of these objects present unique challenges to forward modeling. In particular, complex chemistry arising from molecule-rich atmospheres, molecular opacity line lists (sometimes running to 10 billion absorption lines or more), multiple cloud-forming condensates, and disequilibrium chemical processes all combine to create a challenging task for any modeling effort. This review describes the process of incorporating these complexities into one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium models of substellar objects. We discuss the underlying mathematics as well as the techniques used to model the physics, chemistry, radiative transfer, and other processes relevant to understanding these atmospheres. T...},

abstract = {We describe a new method to achieve point-spread function (PSF) subtractions for high-contrast imaging using principal component analysis that is applicable to both point sources or extended objects (disks). Assuming a library of reference PSFs, a KarhunenL{\`{o}} eve transform of these references is used to create an orthogonal basis of eigenimages on which the science target is projected. For detection this approach provides comparable suppression to the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) algorithm, albeit with increased robustness to the algorithm parameters and speed enhancement. For characterization of detected sources, the method enables forward modeling of astrophysical sources. This alleviates the biases in the astrometry and photometry of discovered faint sources, which are usually associated with LOCI-based PSF subtractions schemes. We illustrate the algorithm performance using archival Hubble Space Telescope images, but the approach may also be considered for ground-based data acquired with angular differential imaging or integral-field spectrographs.},

abstract = {Observations of transiting exoplanets have become an increasingly large proportion of the HST science program. Many of these projects utilize the WFC3/IR channel, a grism so that spectra can be obtained, and scanning the telescope to increase the effective signal to noise and duty cycle of the observation. Typically, visits in these programs involve obtaining data over four contiguous orbits, with the goal of establishing a base-line for the transit observation in the early portion of the visit and a measurement of an exoplanet transit in the latter portion of the visit. In analyzing these visits, most ob-servers discard the first orbit because the apparent flux appears to rise for much of the first orbit before stabilizing in later orbits. This behavior may be due to un-filled traps in the detector diodes. Here we discuss tests intended to pre-condition the detector to reduce this problem using either the internal Tungsten lamp or the astronomical source itself. In our experiments, we do find evidence that conditioning the detector mitigates the rise time effect to a certain extent, reducing the characteristic exponential time scale for the rise from about 4.1 minutes to about 2.5 minutes, and reduces the amplitude of the effect by about factor of about 2. We also characterize the timescale and amplitude of the apparent flux rise in a va-riety of transit observations. Although significant variations are observed in nominally similar observations, some suggestive trends are beginning to appear. In particular, the timescale for stabilizing the flux is shorter for observations with a larger number of scans per orbit than it is for those with fewer scans per orbit. This behavior is not expected based on our current understanding of the traps in the detector diodes associ-ated from a nominally-related phenomenon, namely persistence, exhibited by the WFC3 IR array. It suggests that each time a pixel is illuminated a fraction of the available traps are filled, regardless of the amount of time the pixel is maintained at a particular},

There is some evidence of free-floating planetary- mass objects in young star-forming regions5–8, but these objects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 Jupiter masses with large uncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. Here, we report the discovery of a population of unbound or dis- tant Jupiter-mass objects, which are almost twice (1:8z1:7) as {\{}0:8 common as main-sequence stars, based on two years of gravita- tional microlensing survey observations towards the Galactic Bulge. These planetary-mass objects have no host stars that can be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitational microlensing. However, a comparison with constraints from direct imaging9 suggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any host star. An abrupt change in the mass function at about one Jupiter mass favours the idea that their formation pro- cess is different from that of stars and brown dwarfs. They may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequently scattered into unbound or very distant orbits.}},

Unlike any other discovered exoplanet, models of planetary processes in Proxima b could be contrasted against near future telescopic observations and far future in-situ measurements. In this paper we study the geomagnetic properties of Proxima b analogues, namely, solid planets with masses close but larger than Earth's mass, periods of rotation of several days and habitable surface conditions. Assuming different planetary masses, bulk compositions and periods of rotations, we calculate for each planetary analogue its radius, heat flux, time of inner core formation, dynamo lifetime and minimum dipole magnetic moment.

In the time since Protostars {\&} Planets V, there have been major developments in the availability of rotation period measurements at multiple ages and in different star-forming environments that are essential for testing theory. In parallel, substantial theoretical developments have been carried out in the last few years, including the physics of the star-disk interaction, numerical simulations of stellar winds, and the investigation of angular momentum transport processes in stellar interiors. This chapter reviews both the recent observational and theoretical advances that prompted the development of renewed angular momentum evolution models for cool stars and brown dwarfs. While the main observational trends of the rotational history of low mass objects seem to be accounted for by these new models, a number of critical open issues remain that are outlined in this review.},

abstract = {Abstract The jets of icy particles and water vapor issuing from the south pole of Enceladus are evidence for activity driven by some geophysical energy source. The vapor has also been shown to contain simple organic compounds, and the south polar terrain is bathed in excess heat coming from below. The source of the ice and vapor, and the mechanisms that accelerate the material into space, remain obscure. However, it is possible that a liquid water environment exists beneath the south polar cap, which may be conducive to life. Several theories for the origin of life on Earth would apply to Enceladus. These are (1) origin in an organic-rich mixture, (2) origin in the redox gradient of a submarine vent, and (3) panspermia. There are three microbial ecosystems on Earth that do not rely on sunlight, oxygen, or organics produced at the surface and, thus, provide analogues for possible ecologies on Enceladus. Two of these ecosystems are found deep in volcanic rock, and the primary productivity is based on the co...},

abstract = {Young circumstellar disks are of prime interest to understand the physical and chemical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Only very few detections of planet candidates within these disks exist, and most of them are currently suspected to be disk features. In this context, the transition disk around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap identified in previous observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We aim to search for the presence of planets and search for disk structures indicative for disk-planet interactions and other evolutionary processes. We analyse new and archival near-infrared (NIR) images of the transition disk PDS 70 obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo and Gemini/NICI instruments in polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) and angular differential imaging (ADI) modes. We detect a point source within the gap of the disk at about 195 mas (about 22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at five different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The astrometry results in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The comparison of the measured magnitudes and colours to evolutionary tracks suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass. We confirm the detection of a large gap of about 54 au in size within the disk in our scattered light images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We find that its spatial extent is very likely smaller than about 17 au in radius. The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal brightness distribution which may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very small grains. Future observations of this system at different wavelengths and continuing astrometry will allow us to test theoretical predictions regarding planet-disk interactions, planetary atmospheres and evolutionary models.},

In addition, we present spectrograms, in the wavelength region 6000 - 8000 AA, indicating later spectral types with longer wavelengths. The reason for the color anomalies are unknown, but we are presently investigating the possibility of cooler companion stars and/or large spots on the stellar surface to account for the excesses. This poster is intended to attract the attention to the color anomaly problem. In particular, surface (Doppler) imaging methods are desirable both to investigate the possibility of very large axisymmetric spots and also how hotter ``plage'' regions might affect the color of the star. In addition, synthetic broad band colors of surface maps, ranging from the V to the J-band, are desirable to investigate the resulting color anomalies.},

abstract = {We have reanalyzed archival HST and Subaru data of the recently discovered planetary mass companion (PMC) GQ Lup B. With these we produce the first R- and I-band photometry of the companion and fit a radius and effective temperature using detailed model atmospheres. We find an effective temperature of 2335 ± 100 K, a radius of 0.38 ± 0.05 R☉, and a luminosity of log(L/L☉) = -2.42 ± 0.07 (at 140 pc). Since we fit wavelengths that span most of the emitted radiation from GQ Lup, this luminosity estimate is robust, with uncertainty dominated by the distance uncertainty (±50 pc). The radius obtained for 140 pc (0.38 R☉) is significantly larger than the one originally derived and larger than model predictions. The mass of the object is much more model-dependent than the radiative properties, but for the Gaia dusty models we find a mass between 10MJup and 20MJup, in the range of the brown dwarf and PMC deuterium-burning boundary. Assuming a distance of 140 pc, observations fit to 1 $\sigma$ the Baraffe evolution model for an {\~{}}15MJup brown dwarf. Additionally, the F606W photometric band is significantly overluminous compared to model predictions and other brown dwarfs. Such overluminosity could be explained by a bright H$\alpha$ emission from chromospheric activity, interaction with another undetected companion, or accretion. Assuming that GQ Lup B has a bright H$\alpha$ emission line, its H$\alpha$ emission strength is 10-1.71±0.10Lbol, significantly larger than field late-type dwarfs. GQ Lup B might be strongly accreting and might still be in its formation phase.},

abstract = {Through our HARPS radial velocity survey for planets around solar twin stars, we have identified a promising Jupiter twin candidate around the star HIP11915. We characterize this Keplerian signal and investigate its potential origins in stellar activity. Our analysis indicates that HIP11915 hosts a Jupiter-mass planet with a 3800-day orbital period and low eccentricity. Although we cannot definitively rule out an activity cycle interpretation, we find that a planet interpretation is more likely based on a joint analysis of RV and activity index data. The challenges of long-period radial velocity signals addressed in this paper are critical for the ongoing discovery of Jupiter-like exoplanets. If planetary in nature, the signal investigated here represents a very close analog to the solar system in terms of both Sun-like host star and Jupiter-like planet.},

abstract = {The severely undersampled nature of the WFC3/IR PSF introduces significant complications in the analysis of point sources and barely resolved objects. We have made use of observations of an outer field in Omega Centauri in order to construct PSFs in four wide-band WFC3/IR filters: F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W. Since the F110W PSF is also popular, we used observations of the 47 Tuc calibration field to construct a model for it as well. This document describes the construction of these PSFs, describes their features, and gives a brief tutorial of how to use them to fit objects in images. A follow-on document will make use of the large archive of observations to come up with PSFs for many other WFC3/IR filters. In order to help the community make use of these PSFs, we are currently developing software that can be used to (1) measure stars in images with this PSF and (2) insert stars into flt images such that they can be realistically inserted into drizzled images.},

Our data set includes accreting T Tauri stars in Taurus, Chamaeleon I, $\eta$ Chamaeleon, and the TW Hydra Association. For each source we calculate the accretion rate () by fitting the NUV and optical excesses above the photosphere, produced in the accretion shock, introducing multiple accretion components characterized by a range in energy flux (or density) for the first time. This treatment is motivated by models of the magnetospheric geometry and accretion footprints, which predict that high-density, low filling factor accretion spots coexist with low-density, high filling factor spots. By fitting the UV and optical spectra with multiple accretion components, we can explain excesses which have been observed in the near-IR. Comparing our estimates of to previous estimates, we find some discrepancies; however, they may be accounted for when considering assumptions for the amount of extinction and variability in optical spectra. Therefore, we confirm many previous estimates of the accretion rate. Finally, we measure emission line luminosities from the same spectra used for the estimates, to produce correlations between accretion indicators (H$\beta$, Ca II K, C II], and Mg II) and accretion properties obtained simultaneously.},

abstract = {Several exoplanets have recently been imaged at wide separations of {\textgreater}10 AU from their parent stars. These span a limited range of ages ({\textless}50 Myr) and atmospheric properties, with temperatures of 800-1800 K and very red colors (J − H {\textgreater} 0.5 mag), implying thick cloud covers. Furthermore, substantial model uncertainties exist at these young ages due to the unknown initial conditions at formation, which can lead to an order of magnitude of uncertainty in the modeled planet mass. Here, we report the direct-imaging discovery of a Jovian exoplanet around the Sun-like star GJ 504, detected as part of the SEEDS survey. The system is older than all other known directly imaged planets; as a result, its estimated mass remains in the planetary regime independent of uncertainties related to choices of initial conditions in the exoplanet modeling. Using the most common exoplanet cooling model, and given the system age of 160 +350 −60 Myr, GJ 504b has an estimated mass of 4 +4.5 −1.0 Jupiter masses, among the lowest of directly imaged planets. Its projected separation of 43.5 AU exceeds the typical outer boundary of ∼30 AU predicted for the core accretion mechanism. GJ 504b is also significantly cooler (510 +30 −20 K) and has a bluer color (J − H = −0.23 mag) than previously imaged exoplanets, suggesting a largely cloud-free atmosphere accessible to spectroscopic characterization. Thus, it has the potential of providing novel insights into the origins of giant planets as well as their atmospheric properties.},

Here we analyze ALMA long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of the young star HL Tau, and suggest that the emission dips observed are due to rapid pebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species. Specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially resolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with the expected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other prominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation fronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially with CO and N{\$}{\_}2{\$}) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral index map of HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips are statistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. This variation can be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of solid mass resides in a component that has grown into decimeter size scales inside the dips. Such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile condensation, dust coagulation and settling.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen major progress in our understanding of terrestrial planet formation. Yet key questions remain. In this review we first address the growth of 100 km-scale planetesimals as a consequence of dust coagulation and concentration, with current models favoring the streaming instability. Planetesimals grow into Mars-sized (or larger) planetary embryos by a combination of pebble- and planetesimal accretion. Models for the final assembly of the inner Solar System must match constraints related to the terrestrial planets and asteroids including their orbital and compositional distributions and inferred growth timescales. Two current models -- the Grand-Tack and low-mass (or empty) primordial asteroid belt scenarios -- can each match the empirical constraints but both have key uncertainties that require further study. We present formation models for close-in super-Earths -- the closest current analogs to our own terrestrial planets despite their very different formation histories -- and for terrestrial exoplanets in gas giant systems. We explain why super-Earth systems cannot form in-situ but rather may be the result of inward gas-driven migration followed by the disruption of compact resonant chains. The Solar System is unlikely to have harbored an early system of super-Earths; rather, Jupiter's early formation may have blocked the ice giants' inward migration. Finally, we present a chain of events that may explain why our Solar System looks different than more than 99$\backslash${\%} of exoplanet systems.},

abstract = {Context: T Tauri stars exhibit variability on all timescales, whose origin is still debated.  Aims: We investigate the long term variability of CTTs over up to 20 years, characterize it from a set of statistical parameters and discuss its origin.  Methods: We present a unique, homogeneous database of photometric measurements for Classical T Tauri stars extending up to 20 years. The database contains more than 21 000 UBVR observations of 72 CTTs. All the data were collected within the framework of the ROTOR-program at Mount Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and together they constitute the longest homogeneous, accurate record of TTS variability ever assembled. We characterize the long term photometric variations of 49 CTTs with sufficient data to allow a robust statistical analysis and propose an empirical classification scheme.  Results: Several patterns of long term photometric variability are identified. The most common pattern, exhibited by a group of 15 stars which includes T Tau itself, consists of low level variability ($\Delta$ V≤0.4 mag) with no significant changes occurring from season to season over many years. A related subgroup of 22 stars exhibits a similar stable long term variability pattern, though with larger amplitudes (up to $\Delta$ V≃1.6 mag). Besides these representative groups, we identify three smaller groups of 3-5 stars each which have distinctive photometric properties. Conclusions: The long term variability of most CTTs is fairly stable and merely reflects shorter term variability due to cold and hot surface spots. Only a small fraction of CTTs undergo significant brightness changes on the long term (months, years), which probably arise from slowly varying circumstellar extinction.},

abstract = {To date, several exoplanets have been discovered orbiting stars with close binary companions (a{\~{}}{\textless}30 AU). The fact that planets can form in these dynamically challenging environments implies that planet formation must be a robust process. The initial protoplanetary disks in these systems from which planets must form should be tidally truncated to radii of a few AU, which indicates that the efficiency of planet formation must be high. Here, we examine the truncation of circumstellar protoplanetary disks in close binary systems, studying how the likelihood of planet formation is affected over a range of disk parameters. If the semimajor axis of the binary is too small or its eccentricity is too high, the disk will have too little mass for planet formation to occur. However, we find that the stars in the binary systems known to have planets should have once hosted circumstellar disks that were capable of supporting planet formation despite their truncation. We present a way to characterize the feasibility of planet formation based on binary orbital parameters such as stellar mass, companion mass, eccentricity and semi-major axis. Using this measure, we can quantify the robustness of planet formation in close binaries and better understand the overall efficiency of planet formation in general.},

We develop an analytical model for computation of interior Ohmic dissipation, with a simplified treatment of the atmosphere. We apply our model to HD209458b, Tres-4b, and HD189733b. With conservative assumptions for wind speed and field strength, our model predicts a generated power that appears to be large enough to maintain the transit radii, opening an unexplored avenue toward solving a decade-old puzzle of extrasolar gas giant radius anomalies.},

The light curve shape varies on a timescale of days, suggesting that evolving atmospheric cloud features are responsible. Using interpolations between model atmospheres with differing cloud thicknesses to represent a heterogeneous surface, we find that the multi-wavelength variations and the near-infrared spectrum of 2M2139 can be reproduced by either (1) cool, thick cloud features sitting above a thinner cloud layer, or (2) warm regions of low condensate opacity in an otherwise cloudy atmosphere, possibly indicating the presence of holes or breaks in the cloud layer. We find that temperature contrasts between thick and thin cloud patches must be greater than 175 K and as high as 425 K. We also consider whether the observed variability could arise from an interacting binary system, but this scenario is ruled out. 2M2139 joins the T2.5 dwarf SIMP0136 discovered by Artigau and coworkers as the second L/T transition brown dwarf to display large-amplitude variability on rotational timescales, suggesting that the fragmentation of dust clouds at the L/T transition may contribute to the abrupt decline in condensate opacity and J-band brightening observed to occur over this regime.},

To do so, we use an internal structure model that computes the radius of the planet along with the locations of the different layers of materials, assuming that its mass and bulk composition are known. Lacking detailed elementary abundances of the host star to constrain the planet's composition, we base our model on solar system values. We restrained the simulations to the case of solid planets without massive atmospheres. With these assumptions, the possible radius of Proxima Centauri b spans the 0.94--1.40 {\$}R{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} range. The minimum value is obtained considering a 1.10 {\$}M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} Mercury-like planet with a 65{\%} core mass fraction, whereas the highest radius is reached for 1.46 {\$}M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} with 50{\%} water in mass, constituting an ocean planet. Although this range of radii still allows very different planet compositions, it helps characterizing many aspects of Proxima Centauri b, such as the formation conditions of the system or the current amount of water on the planet. This work can also help ruling out future measurements of the planet's radius that would be physically incompatible with a solid planetary body.},

abstract = {1 Department , University, Rochester, New, 14620 2 Department , University, Seattle, Washington, 98195 3 Max , Jena, Germany Abstract We develop a classification scheme for the evolutionary state of planets based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of their coupled systems, including the presence of a biosphere and the possibility of what we call an " agency-dominated biosphere " (i.e an energy-intensive technological species). The premise is that Earth's entry into the " Anthropocene " represents what might be, from an astrobiological perspective, a predictable planetary transition. We explore this problem from the perspective of the solar system and exoplanet studies. Our classification discriminates planets by the forms of free energy generation driven from stellar forcing. We then explore how timescales for global evolutionary processes on Earth might be synchronized with ecological transformations driven by increases in energy harvesting and its consequences (which might have reached a turning point with global urbanization). Finally, we describe quantitatively the classification scheme based on the maintenance of chemical disequilibrium in the past and current Earth systems and on other worlds in the solar system. In this perspective, the beginning of the Anthropocene can be seen as the onset of the hybridization of the planet -a transitional stage from one class of planetary systems interaction to another. For Earth, this stage occurs as the effects of human civilization yield not just new evolutionary pressures, but new selected directions for novel planetary ecosystem functions and their capacity to generate disequilibrium and enhance planetary dissipation.},

Planet formation is, however, a dynamically active process resulting in collisions between the evolving planetesimals and the production of dust. Thus, indirect observation of planet formation may indeed be possible in the near future. In this paper we present synthetic observations based on numerical N-body simulations of the intermediate phase of planet formation including a state-of-the-art collision model, EDACM, which allows multiple collision outcomes, such as, accretion, erosion, and bouncing events. We show that the formation of planetary embryos may be indirectly observable by a fully functioning ALMA telescope if the surface area involved in planetesimal evolution is sufficiently large and/or the amount of dust produced in the collisions is sufficiently high in mass.},

abstract = {Seven temperate Earth-sized exoplanets readily amenable for atmospheric studies transit the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 (refs 1,2). Their atmospheric regime is unknown and could range from extended primordial hydrogen-dominated to depleted atmospheres3–6. Hydrogen in particular is a powerful greenhouse gas that may prevent the habitability of inner planets while enabling the habitability of outer ones6–8. An atmosphere largely dominated by hydrogen, if cloud-free, should yield prominent spectroscopic signatures in the near-infrared detectable during transits. Observations of the innermost planets have ruled out such signatures 9 . However, the outermost planets are more likely to have sustained such a Neptune-like atmosphere10, 11. Here, we report observations for the four planets within or near the system's habitable zone, the circumstellar region where liquid water could exist on a planetary surface12–14. These planets do not exhibit prominent spectroscopic signatures at near-infrared wavelengths either, which rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f, with significance of 8$\sigma$, 6$\sigma$ and 4$\sigma$, respectively. Such an atmosphere is instead not excluded for planet g. As high-altitude clouds and hazes are not expected in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres around planets with such insolation15, 16, these observations further support their terrestrial and potentially habitable nature.},

abstract = {Context: Understanding the collisional properties of ice is important for understanding both the early stages of planet formation and the evolution of planetary ring systems. Simple chemicals such as methanol and formic acid are known to be present in cold protostellar regions alongside the dominant water ice; they are also likely to be incorporated into planets which form in protoplanetary disks, and planetary ring systems. However, the effect of the chemical composition of the ice on its collisional properties has not yet been studied. Aims: Collisions of 1.5 cm ice spheres composed of pure crystalline water ice, water with 5{\%} methanol, and water with 5{\%} formic acid were investigated to determine the effect of the ice composition on the collisional outcomes. Methods: The collisions were conducted in a dedicated experimental instrument, operated under microgravity conditions, at relative particle impact velocities between 0.01 and 0.19 m s{\^{}}-1, temperatures between 131 and 160 K and a pressure of around 10{\^{}}-5 mbar. Results: A range of coefficients of restitution were found, with no correlation between this and the chemical composition, relative impact velocity, or temperature. Conclusions: We conclude that the chemical composition of the ice (at the level of 95{\%} water ice and 5{\%} methanol or formic acid) does not affect the collisional properties at these temperatures and pressures due to the inability of surface wetting to take place. At a level of 5{\%} methanol or formic acid, the structure is likely to be dominated by crystalline water ice, leading to no change in collisional properties. The surface roughness of the particles is the dominant factor in explaining the range of coefficients of restitution.},

This heterogeneous group includes stars of extremely low mass as well as brown dwarfs (substellar objects not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion), and represents about 15 per cent of the population of astronomical objects near the Sun. Core-accretion theory predicts that, given the small masses of these ultracool dwarfs, and the small sizes of their protoplanetary disks, there should be a large but hitherto undetected population of terrestrial planets orbiting them--ranging from metal-rich Mercury-sized planets to more hospitable volatile-rich Earth-sized planets. Here we report observations of three short-period Earth-sized planets transiting an ultracool dwarf star only 12 parsecs away. The inner two planets receive four times and two times the irradiation of Earth, respectively, placing them close to the inner edge of the habitable zone of the star. Our data suggest that 11 orbits remain possible for the third planet, the most likely resulting in irradiation significantly less than that received by Earth. The infrared brightness of the host star, combined with its Jupiter-like size, offers the possibility of thoroughly characterizing the components of this nearby planetary system.},

Luhman 16B is a known variable whose light curves evolve rapidly. We present spatially resolved spectroscopic time-series of Luhman 16A and B covering 6.5 h using HST/WFC3 at 1.1 to 1.66 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. The small, count-dependent variability of Luhman 16A at the beginning of the observations likely stems from instrumental systematics; Luhman 16A appears non-variable above {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}0.4{\%}. Its spectrum is well fit by a single cloud layer with intermediate cloud thickness (f{\_}sed=2, Teff=1200 K). Luhman 16B varies at all wavelengths with peak-to-valley amplitudes of 7-11{\%}. The amplitude and light curve shape changes over only one rotation period. The lowest relative amplitude is found in the deep water absorption band at 1.4 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m, otherwise it mostly decreases gradually from the blue to the red edge of the spectrum. This is very similar to the other two known highly variable early T dwarfs. A two-component cloud model accounts for most of the variability, although small deviations are seen in the water absorption band. We fit the mean spectrum and relative amplitudes with a linear combination of two models of a warm, thinner cloud (Teff=1300 K, fsed=3) and a cooler, thicker cloud (Teff=1000-1100 K, f{\_}sed=1), assuming out-of-equilibrium atmospheric chemistry. A cloud as for Luhman 16A but with holes cannot reproduce the variability of Luhman 16B, indicating more complex cloud evolution through the L/T transition.

For brown dwarfs, this cooling never stops. Their habitable zone (HZ) thus sweeps inward at least during the first Gyr of their lives. Assuming they possess water, planets found in the HZ of UCDs have experienced a runaway greenhouse phase too hot for liquid water prior to entering the HZ. It has been proposed that such planets are desiccated by this hot early phase and enter the HZ as dry worlds. Here we model the water loss during this pre-HZ hot phase taking into account recent upper limits on the XUV emission of UCDs and using 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. We address the whole range of UCDs but also focus on the planets recently found around the {\$}0.08{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Despite assumptions maximizing the FUV-photolysis of water and the XUV-driven escape of hydrogen, we find that planets can retain significant amounts of water in the HZ of UCDs, with a sweet spot in the {\$}0.04{\$}-{\$}0.06{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} range. We also studied the TRAPPIST-1 system using observed constraints on the XUV-flux. We find that TRAPPIST-1b and c may have lost as much as 15 Earth Oceans and planet d -- which might be inside the HZ -- may have lost less than 1 Earth Ocean. Depending on their initial water contents, they could have enough water to remain habitable. TRAPPIST-1 planets are key targets for atmospheric characterization and could provide strong constraints on the water erosion around UCDs.},

Like Jupiter, it is predicted to have an atmosphere rich in methane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE 0855 is faint at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its energy in the mid-infrared. Skemer et al. (2016) presented a spectrum of WISE 0855 from 4.5–5.1 µm (M band), revealing water vapor features. Here, we present a spectrum of WISE 0855 in L band, from 3.4–4.14 µm. We present a set of atmosphere models that include a range of compositions (metallicities and C/O ratios) and water ice clouds. Methane absorption is clearly present in the spectrum. The mid-infrared color can be better matched with a methane abundance that is depleted relative to solar abundance. We find that there is evidence for water ice clouds in the M band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral features in both the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum opacity source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep phosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate. Observations of WISE 0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres, bridging the temperature range between the long-studied solar system planets and accessible exoplanets. JWST will soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs with high-precision spectroscopy across the infrared, allowing us to study their compositions and cloud properties, and to infer their atmospheric dynamics and formation processes.},

@article{Valenti1993,
abstract = {We present an atlas of 96 low dispersion spectra of T Tauri stars, both classical and weak-lined. The flux-calibrated spectra extend from H-Beta to well blueward of the Balmer jump. Observed equivalent widths and rough blue veilings are presented. We model stars with excess emission as a combination of a weak-lined T Tauri star of a similar spectral type and a slab of hot hydrogen. We tabulate the physical parameters of the slab, and give both intrinsic and observed Balmer jumps. The region responsible for the excess blue continuum has a high density and small surface area, in agreement with previous work. This is consistent with the boundary layer hypothesis, but not unique to it. We suggest that the emission region may actually be the stellar photosphere, heated by accretion shocks at the footprints of magnetic loops extending to the disk. We find that observed infrared excesses are often many times higher than predicted by simple accretion disk models (including reprocessing). The blue excess is more likely to be diagnostic of the actual accretion rate onto the star than the infrared. Typical values for this are a few 10-8 solar mass/yr. Some accreting material may not make it to the star, but is turned around into a wind near the star. The line strengths from the model agree qualitatively with observations of the upper Balmer lines, but are increasingly underestimated for the lower Balmer lines. Including both low and high optical depth components yields better agreement. No weak-lined stars are found to have a Balmer emission jump, confirming that an accretion disk is required to produce this feature in pre-main-sequence stars.},

abstract = {The WFC3 IR array on HST, like other IR detectors, shows afterglows, known as persis-tence, arising from earlier exposures to bright sources. Here we report on calibrations using the internal lamp of the IR channel, intended to characterize one aspect of persis-tence, namely changes in the amount of persistence as a function of the time pixels are held at or near saturation. We find that persistence increases in amplitude and duration as this time increases. The effect is sufficiently large that it should be incorporated into estimates of the amount of persistence that is expected in the IR detector of WFC3.},

abstract = {0 0 M o n t h 2 0 1 7 | V o L 0 0 0 | n A t U R E | 1 Planet formation theories predict that some planets may be ejected from their parent systems as result of dynamical interactions and other processes 1–3 . Unbound planets can also be formed through gravitational collapse, in a way similar to that in which stars form 4 . A handful of free-floating planetary-mass objects have been discovered by infrared surveys of young stellar clusters and star-forming regions 5,6 as well as wide-field surveys 7 , but these studies are incomplete 8–10 for objects below five Jupiter masses. Gravitational microlensing is the only method capable of exploring the entire population of free-floating planets down to Mars-mass objects, because the microlensing signal does not depend on the brightness of the lensing object. A characteristic timescale of microlensing events depends on the mass of the lens: the less massive the lens, the shorter the microlensing event. A previous analysis 11 of 474 microlensing events found an excess of ten very short events (1–2 days)—more than known stellar populations would suggest—indicating the existence of a large population of unbound or wide-orbit Jupiter-mass planets (reported to be almost twice as common as main-sequence stars). These results, however, do not match predictions of planet-formation theories 3,12},

abstract = {Directly detecting thermal emission from young extrasolar planets allows measurement of their atmospheric composition and luminosity, which is influenced by their formation mechanism. Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we discovered a planet orbiting the $\backslash${\$}sim{\$}20 Myr-old star 51 Eridani at a projected separation of 13 astronomical units. Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with strong methane and water vapor absorption. Modeling of the spectra and photometry yields a luminosity of L/LS=1.6-4.0 x 10-6 and an effective temperature of 600-750 K. For this age and luminosity, "hot-start" formation models indicate a mass twice that of Jupiter. This planet also has a sufficiently low luminosity to be consistent with the "cold- start" core accretion process that may have formed Jupiter.},
